## Introduction {#SampleSizeIntroduction}
\index{Sample size estimation}

A confidence interval (CI) is an interval which gives a range of values of the parameter that could plausibly have produced the observed value of the statistic.\index{Confidence intervals}
All else being equal, a *larger* sample size gives a *more precise* estimate of the parameter (Sect.\ \@ref(PrecisionAccuracy));\index{Precision} that is, a *narrower* CI.
After all, that's why larger samples are preferred over smaller samples: they provide more *precise* estimates.


:::{.example #SampleSizeImpact name="Impact of sample size on CIs"}
Suppose we wish to estimate an unknown proportion, and find that $\hat{p} = 0.52$ from a sample of size $n = 25$.
The approximate $95$%\ CI is $0.52 \pm 0.200$ (so the *margin of error* is\ $0.200$).

If the estimate of $\hat{p} = 0.52$ was found from a sample of size $n = 100$ (rather than $n = 25$), a more precise estimate should be expected.
The approximate $95$%\ CI is $0.52\pm 0.100$; the margin of error is\ $0.100$, so the estimate is indeed more precise.

If the estimate of $\hat{p} = 0.52$ was found from a sample of size $n = 400$, the approximate $95$%\ CI is $0.52\pm 0.050$; the margin of error is\ $0.050$ (which is more precise again).

At each step, the sample size was four times as large, but the margin of error was halved.
:::


```{r, child = if (knitr::is_html_output())  './children/SampleSizeCI/SampleSizeCI-HTML.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = if (knitr::is_latex_output()) './children/SampleSizeCI/SampleSizeCI-LaTeX.Rmd'}
```

That is, improving precision gets more difficult as sample sizes get larger: large gains in precision are made by moderately increasing small sample sizes, but only small gains in precision are made by large increases in already-large sample sizes. 


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Remember that the sample size is the number of *units of analysis*.

## General ideas {#SampleSizeIdeas}

If larger samples give more precise estimates, should the largest sample possible always be used?
Not necessarily; using large samples also has disadvantages: 

* as seen above, very large sample sizes only slightly improve precision.
* studies with larger samples sizes take longer to complete.
* studies with larger samples sizes are more expensive.
* ethics committees aim to keep sample sizes as small as possible, so that:\index{Ethics}
  * the environment is impacted as little as possible.
  * the fewest possible animals are harmed.
  * the fewest possible people are harmed or inconvenienced.
  * resources, time and money are not wasted.


::: {.example #Biochar name="The cost of research"}
@farrar2021biochar studied the residual effect of organic biochar compound fertilisers (BCFs) *two years* after application.
This study required planting turmeric in pots using soil previously treated with BCFs.

After the turmeric was grown, the concentration of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen---as well as many trace minerals---was determined from the soil in *every* pot.
In addition, *every* turmeric plant was analysed for the number of shoots, the leaf mass fraction, and foliar nutrient information.

Every pot that is used has a substantial cost, both in terms of time and money.
Using more pots increases precision, but also increases costs and the time to complete the study.
:::


Determining the sample size to use in a study is a trade-off between the advantages of increasing precision, and the challenges of cost, time, and remaining ethical (Chap.\ \@ref(Ethics)).
In addition, *how* the sample is obtained is important: random samples give more *accurate* samples (Sect.\ \@ref(PrecisionAccuracy)) than non-random samples.
That is, the sample size is not the only issue to consider.

For these reasons, researchers usually identify a margin of error that is meaningful (i.e., of practical importance)\index{Practical importance} in the context of their study.


:::{.example #SampleSizeMError name="Practical importance in sample size calculations"}
In a weight-loss study, estimating the weight loss with a precision of\ $1\gs$ is far more precise than is necessary: a weight loss of\ $1\gs$ has no practical importance, but would require a massive sample size to detect.\index{Practical importance}

In contrast, the sample size needed to detect a mean weight loss with a precision of\ $50\kgs$ would be far smaller.
However, a weight loss so great is of no practical importance either, as most people who are looking to lose weight are hoping to lose far less than\ $50\kgs$.

The researchers may decide that a weight loss of\ $5\kgs$ is sufficient to be of practical importance, and determine the sample size based on this value. 
:::



In this chapter, we learn how to compute the (approximate) minimum sample size needed to obtain a given precision (i.e., for a given *margin of error*\index{Margin of error}) for a $95$%\ CI.
The estimation of sample sizes for constructing a CI is studied for these situations:

* estimating a proportion in Sect.\ \@ref(SampleSizeProportions).
* estimating a mean in Sect.\ \@ref(SampleSizeOneMean).
* estimating a mean difference in Sect.\ \@ref(SampleSizeMeanDifferences).
* estimating a difference between two means in Sect.\ \@ref(SampleSizeDifferenceTwoMeans).
* estimating a difference between two proportions in Sect.\ \@ref(SampleSizeDifferenceTwoProportions).

The formulas given in this chapter only apply for *forming $95$%\ CIs*, and are very *conservative*: they will probably give *minimum* samples sizes that are a little *too large*, but that is better than being too small.

To ensure that the required targets are met, the results from the sample size calculation should always be rounded up.
In addition, sample sizes slightly larger than calculated are often used, to allow for *drop-outs*:\index{Drop outs} animals or plants that die; people who can no longer be contacted; and so on.

## Sample size for estimating one proportion {#SampleSizeProportions}
\index{Sample size estimation!one proportion}

In Sect.\ \@ref(Female-Coffee-Drinkers), a CI was formed for the *population* proportion of female college students in the United States that drink coffee daily [@data:Kelpin2018:AlcoholCoffee].
From a sample of $n = 360$, the CI was $0.1694 \pm 0.0395$ (i.e., the *margin of error* is\ $0.0395$), or from\ $0.130$ to\ $0.209$.

To obtain a more precise estimate (i.e., a narrower CI), a larger sample is needed, but how much larger?
For instance, suppose we would like a CI with margin of error of\ $0.02$ (rather than\ $0.0395$).
What size sample is needed?


:::{.definition #SampleSizeProportion name="Sample size: proportion"}
Conservatively, the size of the *simple random sample* needed *for a $95$%\ CI for a proportion* with a specified margin of error is *at least*
$$
   \frac{1}{(\text{Margin of error})^2}.
$$
:::

For the coffee-drinking situation above, at least $\displaystyle 1\div (0.02^2) = 2\ 500$ female college students in the US is needed.
This is a substantial increase from the original sample size of\ $360$.


::: {.example #SampleSizep name="Sample size calculations for one proportion"}

$$
  \frac{1}{(\text{Margin of error})^2} { = \frac{1}{0.07^2}}
$$
people are needed; *at least* $n = 204.08$ people.
In practice, *at least* $205$\ people are needed to achieve this desired level of precision (that is, *always round up* in sample size calculations).

## Sample size for estimating one mean {#SampleSizeOneMean}
\index{Sample size estimation!one mean}

Estimating a mean depends on the variation in the observations.
If the data have a small amount of variation, estimating the mean requires a smaller sample size as most observations are similar.

## Sample size for estimating a mean difference {#SampleSizeMeanDifferences}
\index{Sample size estimation!mean difference}

The ideas in the previous section also work for computing sample sizes for estimating *mean differences*, since the differences can be treated like a single sample.


:::{.definition #SampleSizeMeanDiff name="Sample size: mean difference"}
Conservatively, the size of the *simple random sample* needed *for a $95$%\ CI for the mean difference* with a specified margin of error is *at least*
$$
   \left( \frac{2 \times s_d}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2,
$$
where\ $s_d$ is an estimate of the standard deviation of the population differences.
:::


Again, an approximate value for $s_d$ can come from a pilot study (Sect.\ \@ref(Protocols)),\index{Pilot study} or from the results of a similar study.


```{r}
data(Diabetes)

Diabetes$Diff <- Diabetes$SBPfirst - Diabetes$SBPsecond

n.D.diff <- length( Diabetes$Diff ) - sum( is.na(Diabetes$Diff) )
se.D.diff <- sd(Diabetes$Diff, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n.D.diff)


ci.lo <- mean(Diabetes$Diff) - 2 * se.D.diff
ci.hi <-  mean(Diabetes$Diff) + 2 * se.D.diff
```


::: {.example #SampleSizeWeightGain name="Sample size estimation for mean differences"}
In Sect.\ \@ref(MeanDiffCI), a CI is computed for the difference between the distances walked in $6\mins$ (the six-minute walk test, 6MWT), using a $20\ms$ and\ $30\ms$ walkway [@saiphoklang2022comparison], for $50$\ Thai patients.
The *approximate* $95$%\ CI is from\ $15.80\ms$ to\ $28.26\ms$, further for a $30\ms$\ walkway (i.e., the margin of error is\ $6.234\ms$).

Suppose we wanted to estimate the mean difference in the 6MWT distances for Malaysian patients; we could use the value of\ $s$ from this study (i.e., $s = 22.03920$).
Also, suppose we wanted a precision of\ $4\ms$ (that is, the margin of error is\ $4$).
For this *more precise* estimate, we would need a *larger sample*.
So compute:
$$
   \left( \frac{2 \times 22.03920}{4}\right)^2 = 121.43;
$$ 
we would need at least $122$\ students, after rounding up.

## Sample size for estimating a difference between two means {#SampleSizeDifferenceTwoMeans}
\index{Sample size estimation!difference between means}

A formula for computing sample sizes for estimating the *difference between two means* is simple if we make two assumptions:

* the sample size in both groups being compared is the same.
* the standard deviation in both groups being compared is the same.

Formulas are available for computing sample sizes without these restrictions, but are more complicated than that given here.


:::{.definition #SampleSizeDiffBetweenTwomeans name="Sample size: difference between two means"}
Conservatively, the size of the *simple random sample* needed *for a $95$%\ CI for the difference between two means* with a specified margin of error is *at least*
$$
   2\times \left( \frac{2 \times s}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2
$$
for *each* sample, where\ $s$ is an estimate of the common standard deviation in the population for both groups.
:::



::: {.example #SampleSizeSpeeds name="Sample size estimation for difference between means"}

In Sect.\ \@ref(SpeedSignage), the two groups (before and after signage added) produced standard deviations of\ $13.194$ and\ $13.134$ (which are very similar).
We decide to use $s = 13.15$ in the sample-size calculation as the common value of\ $s$:
$$
   2 \times \left( \frac{2 \times 13.15}{5}\right)^2 = 55.335.
$$ 
We would need to measure the speed of at least\ $56$ cars before signage was added, and another\ $56$ cars after the addition of signage (rounding up the result).

## Sample size for estimating a difference between proportions {#SampleSizeDifferenceTwoProportions}
\index{Sample size estimation!difference between proportions}

A formula for computing sample sizes for estimating the *difference between two proportions* is simple if we assume the sample size in both groups being compared is the same.
Formulas are available for computing sample sizes without this restriction, but are more complicated than that given here.

$$
   \frac{2}{0.15^2} = 88.89.
$$ 
We would need to record data from at least\ $89$ natural nests and\ $89$ relocated nests.
:::



## More details about these sample size calculations {#SampleSizeOtherIssues}

The above calculations form just one part of the information needed to make the final decision about the necessary sample size.
For example, the *cost* (time and money) of taking the samples has not been considered.

The calculations in this chapter assume a *simple random sample* will be used, which is often unreasonable.
Other, more complex, formulas are available for computing sample sizes for other random-sampling schemes (such as stratified samples).
However, the above calculations give an approximate *minimum* sample size required.
In addition, the calculations in this chapter are only for producing $95$%\ CI. 

In practice, researchers often start with a slightly larger sample than calculated to allow for drop-outs\index{Drop outs} (e.g., plants die, or people withdraw from the study).


## Example: emergency residential aged care {#SampleSizeExample}

@dwyer2021residential studied residential aged care residents in Australia needing emergency care and recorded, among other information, the average age of such residents ($\bar{x} = 85$; $s = 7.3$) and the proportion of calls related to falls ($\hat{p} = 0.156$).

Suppose a similar study was to be conducted in New Zealand.
The aim was to estimate the mean age of residents within $2$ years of age, and the proportion of incidents related to falls within\ $0.10$.

Using the value of\ $s$ from Australia, the sample size required to meet the age requirement is at least
$$
  n = \left(\frac{2\times s}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2\times 7.3}{2}\right)^2 = 53.29,
$$
or at least $54$\ residents (rounding up).
The sample size required to meet the falls requirement is at least
$$
  n = \frac{1}{(\text{Margin of error}^2)} = \frac{1}{0.1^2} = 100.
$$
Since the same subjects are needed for both estimates, at least $100$\ residents are needed.


## Chapter summary

Estimating a sample size is a compromise between the precision of the estimate, and the need to remain ethical and reduce costs.
All else being equal, making a sample size four times as large results in a CI half as wide.
This means that large gains in precision are made by increasing small sample sizes, but only small gains are made by increasing already-large sample sizes.

::: {.exercise #SampleSizePneumonia}
Suppose researchers are trialling a new drug to reduce the recovery time (compared to standard treatments) after contracting double pneumonia.
They conduct a pilot study, and find the standard deviation of the duration of the symptoms, in both groups, is about $s = 1.25$ days. 

1. What size sample is needed to estimate the difference between the mean recovery times between the two treatments within\ $1$\ day.
1. What size sample is needed to estimate the difference between the mean recovery times between the two treatments within\ $0.5$\ days.
