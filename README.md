# ResearchMethods

This book is an introduction to quantitative research in the scientific and health disciplines.
The whole research process is introduced,
from asking a research question to analysis and reporting of the data.
The focus, however, is on the analysis of data.

This book was originally prepared for use with the course 
SCI110 *Science Research Methods*^[This name is grammatically incorrect. The book is called the grammatically-correct *Scientific Research Methods*.]
