## Introduction {#Chap35-Intro}

The last chapter introduced *correlation*, which measures the *strength* of the *linear* relationship between two quantitative variables $x$ (an explanatory variable) and $y$ (a response variable).
We now study **regression**, which describes *what* the linear relationship is between $x$ and $y$.
The relationship is described using an *equation*.
This allows us to:

1. **Predict** values of $y$ from given values of $x$ (Sect. \@ref(RegressionForPrediction)); and
2. **Understand** the relationship between $x$ and $y$ (Sect. \@ref(RegressionForUnderstanding)).


## Linear equations: review {#RegressionEquationsReview}

An *example* of a linear regression equation is

\[
  \hat{y} = -4  + 2x.
\]
Here, $x$ refers to the value of the explanatory variable, $y$ refers to the *observed* value of the response variable, and $\hat{y}$ refers to the *mean predicted* value of the response variable a given value of $x$.
More generally, the equation of a straight line is

\[
   \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x
\]
where $b_0$ and $b_1$ are (unknown) numbers.
Notice that $b_1$ is the number multiplied by $x$.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
$y$ refers to the observed data, whose values are known.
$\hat{y}$ refers to *mean predicted* (not observed) values of $y$.
:::



:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}
$\hat{y}$ is pronounced as 'why-hat'; the 'caret' above the $y$ is called a 'hat', and designates a *predicted* value (of $y$).
:::


::: {.example #RegressionEquations name="Regression equations"}
If $\hat{y} = 15  - 102x$, then $b_0 = 15$ and $b_1 = -102$.

Consider the regression equation $\hat{y} = -0.0047x + 2.1$.\label{thinkBox:RegressionCoefs}
What are the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$?
(Be careful!)

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
`r webexercises::hide()`
$b_0 = 2.1$ and $b_1 = -0.0047$.
Remember: $b_1$ is the number multiplied by the $x$, and that $b_0$ is the number by itself.

Some software and some journal papers write regression equations with the value of $b_0$ first, and some with the value of $b_1$ first. 
The *order* is not important.
`r webexercises::unhide()`
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`
:::


The numbers $b_0$ and $b_1$ are called *regression coefficients*, where

* $b_0$ is a number called the **intercept**.
  It corresponds to the *predicted* value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
* $b_1$ is a number called the **slope**.
  It is, on average, how much the value of $y$ changes when the value of $x$ increases by 1.

We will use software to find the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ (the formulas are tedious to use).
However, a rough guess of the values of the *intercept* can be made by drawing a sensible-looking straight line through the data, and determining what that line predicts for the value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
Also, a rough guess of the *slope* can be made by computing

\[
   \text{slope} 
   = \frac{\text{Change in $y$}}{\text{Corresponding change in $x$}}
   = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}.
\]
This guess of the slope is the *change* in the value of $y$ (the 'rise') divided by the corresponding *change* in the value of $x$ (the 'run').

Consider the scatterplot in Fig. \@ref(fig:ExampleScatter).
I have drawn a sensible line on the graph to capture the relationship (your line may look a little different).
When $x = 0$, the regression line predicts the value of $y$ to be about 2, so $b_0$ is approximately 2.

To guess the slope, use the 'rise over run'
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'idea (Fig. \\@ref(fig:RiseRun); the online version has an animation).'
} else {
   'idea; the animation below may help explain.'
}`
When the value of $x$ increases from 1 to 5 (a change of $5 - 1 = 4$), the corresponding value of $y$ changes from 5 to 17 (a change of $17 - 5 = 12$).
So:

\[
   \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} 
   = \frac{17 - 5}{5 - 1}
   = \frac{12}{4} 
   = 3.
\]
The value of $b_1$ is about $3$.
The regression line is approximately $\hat{y} = 2 + (3\times x)$, usually written

\[
  \hat{y} = 2 + 3x.
\]

::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The equation uses $\hat{y}$ and not $y$ on the left-hand side.
That is, the equation *predicts* value of $y$, which may not be equal to the observed values (which are denoted by $y$).

A 'good' regression equation would produce predicted values $\hat{y}$ close to the observed values $y$.
:::


The *intercept* has the same measurement units as the response variable.
The measurement unit for the *slope* is the 'measurement units of the response variable', per 'measurement units of the explanatory variable'.



:::{.example name="Measurement units for intercept and slope"}
For the red-deer data, explanatory variable is age (in years), and the response variable is molar weight (in g).
In the regression equation, the intercept is measured in 'grams', and the *slope* is measured in 'grams per year'.

::: {.example #CycloneRegressionGuesses name="Estimating regression parameters"}
The relationship between the number of cyclones $y$ in the Australian region each year from 1969 to 2005, and a climatological index called the *Ocean `r readr::parse_character( c("Niño"), locale=locale(encoding="UTF-8"))` Index* (ONI, $x$), is shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:ONIcyclones) [@mypapers:dunnsmyth:glms].

When the value of $x$ is zero, the predicted value of $y$ is about 12; $b_0$ is about 12.
(You may get something slightly different.)
Notice that the intercept is the *predicted* value of $y$ when $x = 0$, which is *not* at the left of the graph.

To guess the value of $b_1$, use the 'rise over run' idea.
When $x$ is about $-2$, the predicted value of $y$ is about 17; when $x$ is about $2$, the predicted value of $y$ is about 8.
The value of $x$ increase by $2 - (-2) = 4$,  while the value of $y$ changes by $8 - 17 = -9$ (a *decrease* of about 9).
Hence, $b_1$ is approximately $-9/4 = -2.25$.
(You may get something slightly different.)
The relationship has a *negative* direction, so the slope must be *negative*.
The regression line is approximately $\hat{y} = 12 - 2.25x$.

The above method gives a crude guess of the values of the intercept $b_0$ and the slope $b_1$.
In practice, *many* reasonable lines could be drawn through a scatterplot of data.
However, one of those lines is the 'best' line in some sense^[For those interested: The 'line of best fit' has the sum of the *squared* vertical distances between the observations and the line is as small as possible.].
Software calculates this 'line of best fit' for us.

The formulas for computing $b_0$ and $b_1$ are intimidating, so we will use software to do the calculations.

part of the relevant output is shown in Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamoviraw) (using jamovi) and Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionSPSSraw) (using SPSS).
From the output, the sample *slope* is $b_1 = `r RD.b1`$, and the sample $y$-intercept is $b_0 = `r RD.b0`$: the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ are in the column labelled  `Estimate` in jamovi, and the column labelled `B` in SPSS.
These are the values of the two *regression coefficients*; so

\[
	\hat{y} = `r RD.b0` + (`r RD.b1`\times x),
\]
usually written more simply as

\[
	\hat{y} = `r RD.b0` - `r abs(RD.b1)` x.

Since $x$ represents the age, use $x = 10$ in the regression equation:

\begin{eqnarray*}
         \hat{y} 
         &=& `r RD.b0` - (`r abs(RD.b1)`\times 10)\\
         &=& `r RD.b0` - `r abs(RD.b1 * 10)` = `r RD.b0 + RD.b1*10`.
\end{eqnarray*}
Male red deer aged 10 years old are predicted to have a *mean* molar weight of `r  RD.b0 + RD.b1*10` grams.
Some individual deer aged 10 will have molars weighing *more* than this, and some weighing *less* than this.
The model predicts that the *mean* molar weight for male red deer aged 10 will be about `r RD.b0 + RD.b1*10` grams.

What is the predicted mean molar weight for:\label{thinkBox:Predictions}

* For male red deer $12$ years of age?
* For male red deer $20$ years of age?

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
`r webexercises::hide()`
* Prediction: $4.398 - (0.181 \times 12) = 2.226$, or about 2.23 grams.
* Prediction: $4.398 - (0.181 \times 20) = 0.778$, or about 0.78 grams.

This last prediction *may* be a useful prediction...but it may be rubbish.
In the data, the oldest deer is aged 14.4 years, so the regression line may not even apply for deer aged over 14.4 years of age.
For example, the relationship may be non-linear after 14 years of age, or red deer may not even live to 20 years of age.
The prediction *may* be sensible... but it *may not* be either.

We don't know whether the prediction is sensible or not, because we have no data for deer aged over 14.4 years to inform us.
Making prediction outside the range of the available data is called *extrapolation*, and *extrapolation* beyond the data can lead to nonsense predictions.


::: {.definition #Extrapolation name="Extrapolation"}
*Extrapolation* refers to making predictions outside the range of the available data.
Extrapolation beyond the data can lead to nonsense predictions.

## Regression for understanding {#RegressionForUnderstanding}

The regression equation can be used to *understand* the relationship between the two variables.
Consider again the red-deer regression equation:

\begin{equation}
   \hat{y}
   = 
   `r RD.b0` 
   - 
    `r abs(RD.b1)` x.
   (\#eq:RedDeerEquation)
\end{equation}
What does it tell us about the relationship between $x$ and $y$?


### The meaning of $b_0$

$b_0$ is the *predicted* value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
Equation \@ref(eq:RedDeerEquation) predicts a molar weight of $`r RD.b0`$ for a deer zero years of age.
This may be nonsense: it is *extrapolating* beyond the data (the youngest deer in the sample is aged 4.4 years).


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The value of the intercept $b_0$ is sometimes (but not always) meaningless.
The value of the slope $b_1$ is usually of greater interest, as it explains the *relationship* between the two variables.
:::


### The meaning of $b_1$ {#SlopeMeaning}

$b_1$ tells us how much the value of $y$ changes (on average) when the value of $x$ *increase* by one.
For the red-deer data, $b_1$ tells us how much the molar weight changes (on average) when age increases by one year.

Each extra year older is associated with an average change of $`r RD.b1`$ grams in molar weight; that is, a *decrease* in molar weight by a mean of $`r abs(RD.b1)`$.
The molars of some individual deer will lose more weight than this in some years, and some will lose less... the value is a *mean* weight loss per year.

To demonstrate: When $x = 10$, $y$ is predicted to be $\hat{y}= `r RD.b0 + 10 * RD.b1`$.
For deer one year older than this (i.e.\ $x = 11$) we predict $y$ to be $b_1 = `r RD.b1`$ higher (or, equivalently, 0.181 *lower*).
That is, we would predict $\hat{y}= `r RD.b0 + 10*RD.b1`  - `r abs(RD.b1)` = `r RD.b0 + 11*RD.b1`$.
(This is the same prediction made by using $x = 11$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:RedDeerEquation).)


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
If the value of $b_1$ is *positive*, then the predicted values of $y$ *increase* as the values of $x$ *increase*.
If the value of $b_1$ is *negative*, then the predicted values of $y$ *decrease* as the values of $x$ *increase*.
:::


This interpretation of $b_1$ explains the relationship: Each extra year of age reduces the weight of the molars by 0.181 grams, on average, in male red deer.
Recall that the units of measurement of the slope here are 'grams per year').

Observe what happens if the slope is *zero*.
Since $b_1$ is the change in $y$ (on average) when $x$ increase by one, $b_1 = 0$ means that the value of $y$ changes by *zero* if the value of $x$ changes by one.
In other words, if the value of $x$ changes, the predicted value of $y$ doesn't change.
This is equivalent to saying that there is *no relationship* between the variables.
(We would also find $r = 0$.)


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
If the value of the slope is zero, there is *no linear relationship* between $x$ and $y$.
In this case, the correlation coefficient is also zero.
:::


## Hypothesis testing {#RegressionHT}

### Introduction {#RegressionTests-Intro}

The regression line is computed from the *sample*, assuming a linear relationship actually exists in the *population*.
The (unknown) regression line in the *population* is

\[
	\hat{y} = {\beta_0} + {\beta_1} x.
\]
From the *sample*, the *estimate* of the *population* regression line (Appendix \@ref(StatisticsAndParameters)) is

\[
	\hat{y} = {b_0} + {b_1} x.
\]
That is, the intercept in the population is $\beta_0$ (estimated by $b_0$), and the slope in the population is $\beta_1$ (estimated by $b_1$).

The *sample* can be used to ask questions about the unknown *population* regression coefficients.
As usual, the sample estimates can vary across all possible samples (and so have a *sampling distribution*).
Usually questions are asked about the *slope*, because the slope explains the  *relationship* between the two variables (Sect. \@ref(RegressionForUnderstanding)).


### Statistical hypotheses

The null hypothesis is the usual 'no relationship' hypothesis.
In this context, 'no relationship' means that the slope is zero (Sect. \@ref(SlopeMeaning)), so the null hypotheses (about the *population*) is:

* $H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$.

This hypothesis proposes that $b_1$ is not zero because of sampling variation.
As part of the [decision-making process](#DecisionMaking), the null hypothesis is initially **assumed** to be true.
For the red deer data (Sect. \@ref(RedDeerData)), to determine if a relationship exists between the age of the deer and the weight of their molars implies these hypotheses:

\[
   \text{$H_0$}: \beta_1 = 0;\quad\text{and}\quad\text{$H_1$}: \beta_1 \ne 0.
\]
The parameter is $\beta_1$, the population slope for the regression equation predicting molar weight from age.
The alternative hypothesis is two-tailed, based on the RQ.


```{r}
RD.fitinfo <- summary(RD.lm)$coefficients
RD.t <- RD.fitinfo[, "t value"]
RD.P <- RD.fitinfo[, "Pr(>|t|)"]
```


### Describing the sampling distribution {#sampling-distribution-expectation-slope}

*Assuming* the null hypothesis is true (that $\beta_1 = 0$), we can describe what values the sample slope $b_1$ are *expected* to take, through *sampling variation*.
The variation in the sample slope across all possible samples is described (Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerSlopeSampDist)) using:

* an approximate normal distribution,
* with a mean of $\beta_1 = 0$ (from $H_0$), and 
* a standard deviation, called the *standard error of the slope*, of $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$.

The standard error is found using software (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionSPSS)).


```{r RedDeerSlopeSampDist, fig.cap="The distribution of sample slopes for the red deer data, if the population slope is 0", fig.align="center", fig.height=3.0, fig.width=8, out.width='85%'}
mn <- 0
se <- 0.0289

out <- plotNormal(mu = mn, 
                  sd = se,
                  round.dec = 4,
                  main = "", # Main title
                  xlab = "Sample regression slopes", # horizontal axis labels
                  showZ = TRUE) # Whether to show z = -3:3 or not

  
```


### Computing the test statistic

The **observed** sample slope was $b_1 = -0.181$.
The *test statistic* would be found using the usual approach when the sampling distribution has an approximate normal distribution:

\begin{align*}
   t 
   &= \frac{\text{sample statistic} - \text{assumed population parameter}}{\text{standard error of the sample statistic}}\\
   &= \frac{ b_1 - \beta_1}{\text{s.e.}(b_1)} \\
   &= \frac{-0.181 - 0}{0.0289} = -6.27,
\end{align*}
where the values of $b_1$ and $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$ are taken from the software output (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionSPSS)).
The $t$-score is also reported by the software.


### Determining the $P$-value

To determine if the statistic is *consistent* with the null hypothesis, the $P$-value can be approximated using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule), or taken from software output (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionSPSS)).
Using software, the $P$-value is $P < 0.001$.


### Writing conclusions

We write:

> The sample presents very strong evidence ($t = -6.27$; one-tailed $P < 0.001$) that the slope in the population between age of the deer and molar weight is not zero (slope: $-0.181$).

::: {.example #EDpatientsRegression name="Emergency department patients"}
A study examined the relationship between the number of emergency department (ED) patients and the number of days following the distribution of monthly welfare monies [@brunette1991correlation] from 1986 to 1988 in Minneapolis, USA.
The data (extracted from Fig. 2 of @brunette1991correlation) is displayed in Fig. \@ref(fig:EDScatter).
From the jamovi output (Fig. \@ref(fig:EDRegressionjamovi)), the regression line is estimated as 

\[
  \hat{y} = 150.19 - 0.348x, 
\]
where $y$ represents the mean number of ED patients, and $x$ the number of days since welfare distribution.
This regression equation suggests that each extra day after welfare distribution is associated with a *decrease* in the number of ED patients of about 0.35.
It may be easier to understand this way: 

> Each 10 extra days after welfare distribution is associated with a *decrease* in the number of ED patients of about $10\times 0.35 = 3.5$.

The scatterplot and the regression equation suggests a negative relationship between the number of ED patients and the days after distribution.
However, every sample is likely to be different, so the relationship may not actually be present in the population (the slope may be non-zero due to sampling variation).
We can test these hypotheses:

\[
   \text{$H_0$}: \beta_1 = 0\quad\text{and}\quad\text{$H_1$}: \beta_1 \ne 0,
\]
where $\beta_1$ is the *population* slope.
The test is two-tailed, based on the authors' aim.
From the output, the test statistic is $t = -7.45$, which is very large; unsurprisingly, the two-tailed $P$-value is very small: $P < 0.001$.
We write:

> Very strong evidence exists ($t = -7.45$; two-tailed $P < 0.001$) of a relationship between the mean number of ED patients and the number of days after welfare distribution (slope: $-0.348$).

## Confidence intervals {#RegressionCI}

Reporting the CI for the slope is also useful, which can be obtained from software or computed manually.


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
Using the output (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionSPSS)), can you determine the *approximate* 95% CI for $\beta_1$?\label{thinkBoxCI}
:::


CIs have the form

\[
  \text{statistic} \pm ( \text{multiplier} \times \text{standard error}).
\]
The multiplier is two for an approximate 95% CI, so (using the standard error reported by the software), an approximate 95% CI is $-0.181 \pm (2\times 0.029)$, or $-0.181 \pm 0.058$, or from $-0.239$ to $-0.123$.
Software can produce *exact* CIs too (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamoviCI); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionSPSSCI)).
The *approximate* and *exact* 95% CIs are very similar.
We write:

> The sample presents very strong evidence ($P < 0.001$; $t = `r round(RD.t[2], 3)`$) of a relationship between age and the weight of molars in male red deer (slope: $`r RD.b1`$; $n= `r length(RD$Age)`$; 95% CI from $-0.239$ to $-0.124$) in the population.


```{r RedDeerRegressionjamoviCI, fig.cap="jamovi output for the red-deer data, including the CIs", fig.align="center", out.width="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics( "SPSS/RedDeer/RedDeer-Regression-CI.png")
```



::: {.example #EDpatientsCI name="Emergency department patients"}
In Example \@ref(exm:EDpatientsRegression), the 95% CI for the slope is not shown in the output.
However, CIs have the form
\[
  \text{statistic} \pm ( \text{multiplier} \times \text{standard error}),
\]
so the CI is easily computed:
\[
  -0.34790 \pm (2\times 0.046672), 
\]  
or $-0.34790 \pm 0.093344$, equivalent to $-0.441$ to $-0.255$.
Combining with information from Example \@ref(exm:EDpatientsRegression), we write:

> The sample presents very strong evidence ($P < 0.001$; $t = -7.45$) of a relationship between the mean number of ED patients and the numbers of days after welfare distribution (slope: $-0.348$; $n = 30$; 95% CI from $-0.441$ to $-0.255$) in the population.

## Statistical validity conditions

As usual, these results hold under [certain conditions to be met](#exm:StatisticalValidityAnalogy).
The conditions for which the test is statistically valid are the same as for correlation (Sect. \@ref(ValidityCorrelation)):

1. The relationship is approximately linear.
1. The variation in the response variable is approximately constant for all values of the explanatory variable.
1. The sample size is at least 25.

The sample size of 25 is a rough figure here, and some books give other values.


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityDeerReg name="Statistical validity"}
For the red deer data, the relationship is approximately linear, and the variation in molar weight appears to be somewhat constant for various ages
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  '(Fig. \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)),'
} else {
  '(Fig. \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatterHTML)),'
}
`
so regression is appropriate.
The sample size is $n = 78$.
The results from the hypothesis test should be statistically valid.
:::


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
Are the conditions for statistically validity met for the cyclones data (Fig. \@ref(fig:ONIcyclones))?\label{thinkBoxRegressionConditions}

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
`r webexercises::hide()`
Looking at all three conditions:

* Linearity: The relationship looks approximately linear.
* Variation: The variations seems somewhat constant for all values of $x$ (the ONI), but it is a little hard to be sure.
* Sample size: The sample size is larger than 25.

The conditions for statistical validity appear to have been met.
`r webexercises::unhide()`
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

::: {.example #EDpatientsValidity name="Emergency department patients"}
In Example \@ref(exm:EDpatientsRegression), the scatterplot (Fig. \@ref(fig:EDScatter)) shows the relationship is approximately linear, that the variation in ED patients seems reasonably constant for different numbers of days after distribution, and the sample size is larger than 25.
The test (Example \@ref(exm:EDpatientsRegression)) and the CI (Example \@ref(exm:EDpatientsCI)) should be statistically valid.

Using the jamovi output (Fig. \@ref(fig:OSARegressionjamovi)) the value of the slope and $y$-intercept in the *sample* are $b_0 = -24.47$ and $b_1 = 1.36$.
The regression equation is 

\[ 
  \hat{y} = -24.47 + 1.36x.
\]
The slope means that for each one centimetre increase in neck circumference, the number of sleep disruptions per hour increase (on average) by about 1.36.

Each sample will produce slightly different *sample* slopes, so we can test to see if the slope in the *population* is non-zero due to sampling variation, using a hypothesis test:

\[
   \text{$H_0$}: \beta_1 = 0\quad\text{and}\quad\text{$H_1$}: \beta_1 \ne 0\quad \text{(that is, two-tailed)}.
\]
The parameter is $\beta_1$.
From the software output, $t = 2.09$ and the two-tailed $P$-value is $P = 0.041$, so moderate evidence exists that the neck circumference is associated with greater REI.

The *approximate* 95% CI for the population slope $\beta_1$ is 

\[
   1.3663 \pm (2\times 0.65441),
\]
or from 0.057 to 2.68.
From the scatterplot (Fig. \@ref(fig:OSAscatter)) the results appear statistically valid.
We write:

> The sample presents moderate evidence ($t = 2.09$; two-tailed $P = 0.041$) of a relationship between neck circumference and REI (slope: $1.36$; $n = 60$; 95% CI from $0.057$ to $2.68$) in the population.

The slope means that when the dry matter weight digestibility increases by 1 percentage point, the digestible energy increases, on average, by 0.047 Cal/gram.
Each sample will produce slightly different *sample* slopes, so we can test to see if the slope in the *population* is non-zero due to sampling variation, using a hypothesis test:

\[
   \text{$H_0$}: \beta_1 = 0\quad\text{and}\quad\text{$H_1$}: \beta_1 > 0 \quad\text{(i.e., one-tailed)}.
\]
The parameter is $\beta_1$, the population slope for the regression equation predicting digestible energy from dry matter weight.
The alternative hypothesis is *one*-tailed, based on the RQ.

From the software output, $t = 39.322$, which is huge; the **two-tailed** $P$-value is $P < 0.001$.
Since the alternative hypothesis is **one-tailed** , the $P$-value is less than $0.001/2 = 0.0005$.
There is *very* strong evidence that the digestible energy increases as the dry matter weight digestibility increases.
The *approximate* 95% CI for the population slope $\beta_1$ is $0.047 \pm (2\times 0.001)$, or from 0.045 to 0.049.


```{r RuminantRegressionjamovi, fig.cap="jamovi output for the sheep-feed data", fig.align="center", out.width="60%"}

```

The results are statistically valid.
We write:


> The sample presents very strong evidence ($t = 39.322$; one-tailed $P < 0.0005$) of a relationship between dry matter weight digestibility and the digestible energy (slope: $0.047$;  $n = 36$; 95% CI from $-0.045$ to $-0.049$) in the population.

## Summary {#Chap35-Summary}

In this chapter, we have learnt about **regression**, which mathematically describes the relationship between two *quantitative* variables.
The response variable is denoted by $y$, and the explanatory variable by $x$.
The linear relationship between them (the **regression equation**), in the sample, is

\[
   \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x,
\]
where $b_0$ is a number (the **intercept**), $b_1$ is a number (the **slope**), and the 'hat' above the $y$ indicates that the equation gives an *predicted* mean value of $y$ for the given $x$ value.

The *intercept* is the predicted mean value of $y$ when the value of $x$ is zero.
The *slope* is how much the predicted mean value of $y$ changes, on average, when the value of $x$ *increases* by 1.

The regression equation can be used to make *predictions* or to *understand* the relationship between the two variables.
Predictions made with values of $x$ outside the values of $x$ used to create the regression equation (called *extrapolation*) may not be reliable.

In the population, the regression equation is

\[
   \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x.
\]
To test a hypothesis about a population slope $\beta_1$, based on the value of the sample slope $b_1$, **assume** the value of $\beta_1$ in the null hypothesis (usually zero) to be true.
Then, the sample slope varies from sample to sample and, under certain statistical validity conditions, varies with an approximate normal distribution centered around the hypothesised value of $\beta_1$, with a standard deviation of $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$.
This distribution describes what values of the sample slope could be **expected** in the sample if the value of $\beta_1$ in the null hypothesis was true.

The *test statistic* is

\[
   t = \frac{ b_1 - \beta_1}{\text{s.e.}(b_1)},
\]
where $\beta_1$ is the hypothesised value given in the null hypothesis (usually zero).
The $t$-value is like a $z$-score, and so an approximate **$P$-value** can be estimated using the  [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule).
