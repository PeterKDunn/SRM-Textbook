## Introduction {#Chap35-Intro}

The last chapter introduced *correlation*, which measures the *strength* of the *linear* relationship between two quantitative variables $x$ (an explanatory variable) and $y$ (a response variable).
We now study *regression*, which describes *what* the linear relationship is between $x$ and $y$.
The relationship is described using an *equation*, which allows us to:

1. *Predict* values of $y$ from given values of $x$ (Sect.\ \@ref(RegressionForPrediction)); and
2. *Understand* the relationship between $x$ and $y$ (Sect.\ \@ref(RegressionForUnderstanding)).

An example of a linear regression equation, describing the relationship between an explanatory variable $x$ and a response variable $y$, is    
\[
  \hat{y} = -4  + (2\times x), \qquad\text{usually written}\qquad \hat{y} = -4  + 2x.
\]
The notation $\hat{y}$ refers to the *mean predicted* value of the response variable given a value of $x$.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
$y$ refers to the observed data, whose values are known.
$\hat{y}$ refers to *mean predicted* (not observed) values of $y$ for some given value of $x$.
:::



:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}
$\hat{y}$ is pronounced as 'why-hat'; the 'caret' above the $y$ is called a 'hat', and designates a *predicted* value (of $y$).
:::


More generally, the equation of a straight line is  
\[
   \hat{y} = b_0 + (b_1 \times x), \qquad\text{usually written}\qquad \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x
\]
where $b_0$ and $b_1$ are (unknown) numbers estimated from sample data.
Notice that $b_1$ is the number multiplied by $x$.
In the example above, $b_0 = -4$ and $b_1 = 2$.


::: {.example #RegressionEquations name="Regression equations"}
If $\hat{y} = 15  - 102x$, then $b_0 = 15$ and $b_1 = -102$.

Consider the regression equation $\hat{y} = -0.0047x + 2.1$.\label{thinkBox:RegressionCoefs}
What are the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$?
(Be careful!)

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
`r webexercises::hide()`
$b_0 = 2.1$ and $b_1 = -0.0047$.
Remember: $b_1$ is the number multiplied by the $x$, and that $b_0$ is the number by itself.

Some software and some journal papers write regression equations with the value of $b_0$ first, and some with the value of $b_1$ first. 
The *order* is not important.

## Linear equations: review {#RegressionEquationsReview}

To introduce, or revise, the idea of a linear equation, consider the (artificial) data in 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterLATEX) (left panel),'
} else {
   'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterHTML),'
}`
with an explanatory variable $x$ and a response variable $y$.
In the regression equation $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x$, the numbers $b_0$ and $b_1$ are called *regression coefficients*, where

* $b_0$ is called the *intercept*.
  Its value corresponds to the *predicted* mean value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
* $b_1$ is the *slope*.
  It measures how much the value of $y$ changes, on average, when the value of $x$ *increases* by 1.

We will use software to find the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ (the formulas are tedious to use).

A rough approximation of the value of the *intercept* can be made by drawing a sensible-looking straight line through the scatterplot of the data, and determining what that line predicts for the value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
Also, a rough approximation of the *slope* can be made by computing  
\[
   \text{approximate slope} 
   = \frac{\text{Change in $y$}}{\text{Corresponding change in $x$}}
   = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}.
\]
This approximation of the slope is the *change* in the value of $y$ (the 'rise') divided by the corresponding *change* in the value of $x$ (the 'run').
In
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterLATEX) (left panel),'
} else {
   'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterHTML),'
}`
I have drawn a sensible line on the graph to capture the relationship (your line may look a little different).
When $x = 0$, the regression line predicts the value of $y$ to be about $2$, so $b_0$ is approximately $2$.

To approximate the slope, use the 'rise over run'
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'idea (Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterLATEX), right panel; the online version has an animation).'
} else {
   'idea; the animation below may help explain.'
}`
When the value of $x$ increases from $1$ to $5$ (a change of $5 - 1 = 4$), the corresponding value of $y$ changes from $5$ to $17$ (a change of $17 - 5 = 12$).
So:  
\[
   \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} 
   = \frac{17 - 5}{5 - 1}
   = \frac{12}{4} 
   = 3.
\]
The value of $b_1$ is about $3$.
The regression line is approximately $\hat{y} = 2 + (3\times x)$, usually written  
\[
  \hat{y} = 2 + 3x.
\]

::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The regression equation has $\hat{y}$ (not $y$) on the left-hand side.
That is, the equation *predicts* the mean values of $y$, which may not be equal to the observed values (which are denoted by $y$).

A 'good' regression equation would produce predicted values $\hat{y}$ close to the observed values $y$; that is, the lines passes close to each point on the scatterplot.
:::


The *intercept* has the same measurement units as the response variable.
The measurement unit for the *slope* is the 'measurement units of the response variable', per 'measurement units of the explanatory variable'.



:::{.example name="Measurement units for intercept and slope"}
For the red-deer data, explanatory variable is age (in years), and the response variable is molar weight (in g).
Hence, the intercept $b_0$ is measured in grams, and the slope $b_1$ is measured in grams per year.

::: {.example #CycloneRegressionGuesses name="Estimating regression parameters"}
The relationship [@mypapers:dunnsmyth:glms] between the number of cyclones $y$ in the Australian region each year from 1969 to 2005, and a climatological index called the *Ocean `r readr::parse_character( c("Niño"), locale=locale(encoding="UTF-8"))` Index* (ONI, $x$), is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ONIcyclones).

When the value of $x$ is zero, the predicted value of $y$ is about $12$; $b_0$ is about $12$.
(You may get something slightly different.)
Notice that the intercept is the *predicted* value of $y$ when $x = 0$, which is *not* at the left of the graph.

To approximate the value of $b_1$, use the 'rise over run' idea.
When $x$ is about $-2$, the predicted value of $y$ is about $17$; when $x$ is about $2$, the predicted value of $y$ is about $8$.
The value of $x$ increases by $2 - (-2) = 4$,  while the value of $y$ changes by $8 - 17 = -9$ (a *decrease* of about $9$).
Hence, $b_1$ is approximately $-9/4 = -2.25$.
(You may get something slightly different.)
The relationship has a *negative* direction, so the slope must be *negative*.
The regression line is approximately $\hat{y} = 12 - 2.25x$.

The above method gives a crude approximation to the values of the intercept $b_0$ and the slope $b_1$.
In practice, *many* reasonable lines could be drawn through a scatterplot of data.
However, one of those lines is the 'best' line in some sense^[For those interested: The 'line of best fit' is the line for which the sum of the *squared* vertical distances between the observations $y$ and the predicted values $\hat{y}$ (i.e, the regression line) is as small as possible.].
Software calculates this 'line of best fit' for us.

## Regression using software {#Regression-Software}

The regression line, explained above, is computed from the observed sample data.
This assumes that a regression equation exists in the population that is being estimated using the sample information.
In the population, the intercept is denoted by $\beta_0$ and the slope by $\beta_1$.
These population values are unknown, and are estimated by the statistics $b_0$ and $b_1$ respectively.


:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}

::: {style="display: flex;"}
The symbol $\beta$ is the Greek letter 'beta', pronounced 'beater' (as in 'egg beater').  
So $\beta_0$ is said as 'beater-zero', and $\beta_1$ as 'beater-one'.

Every sample is likely to produce a slightly different value for both $b_0$ and $b_1$ (*sampling variation*), so both $b_0$ and $b_1$ have a standard error.
The formulas for computing the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ are intimidating, so we will allow software to do the calculations.

## Regression for predictions {#RegressionForPrediction}

</div>


The regression equation for the red-deer data, estimated from one of the many possible samples, is $\hat{y} = `r RD.b0` - `r abs(RD.b1)` x$, and can be used to make *predictions* of the mean value of $y$ for a given value of $x$; for example, predicting the *average* molar weight for deer $10$ years old.
Since $x$ represents the age, use $x = 10$ in the regression equation:  
\begin{eqnarray*}
         \hat{y} 
         &=& `r RD.b0` - (`r abs(RD.b1)`\times 10)\\
         &=& `r RD.b0` - `r abs(RD.b1 * 10)` = `r RD.b0 + RD.b1*10`.
\end{eqnarray*}
Male red deer aged $10$ years are predicted to have a *mean* molar weight of $`r  RD.b0 + RD.b1*10`$ grams.
Some individual deer aged $10$ will have molars weighing *more* than this, and some weighing *less* than this; the model predicts that the *mean* molar weight for male red deer aged $10$ will be about $`r RD.b0 + RD.b1*10`$ grams.

(Note: The value of $\hat{y}$ is computed using the estimates $b_0$ and $b_1$, which are in turn computed from sample data. 
Hence, the value of $\hat{y}$ is also based on the sample information, so also has a standard error.)

:::

Suppose we were interested in male red deer $20$ years of age; the mean predicted weight of the molars would be $4.398 - (0.181 \times 20) = 0.778$, or about $0.78$ grams.
However, while this prediction *may* be a useful prediction... it may be rubbish.

In the data, the oldest deer is aged $14.4$ years, so the regression line may not even apply for deer aged over $14.4$ years of age.
For example, the relationship may be non-linear after $14$ years of age, or red deer may not even live to $20$ years of age.
The prediction *may* be sensible... but it *may not* be either.

We don't know whether the prediction is sensible or not, because we have no data for deer aged over $14.4$ years to inform us.
Making predictions outside the range of the available data is called *extrapolation*, and *extrapolation* beyond the data may lead to nonsense predictions.


::: {.definition #Extrapolation name="Extrapolation"}
*Extrapolation* refers to making predictions outside the range of the available data.
Extrapolation beyond the data may lead to nonsense predictions.
:::


## Regression for understanding {#RegressionForUnderstanding}

The regression equation can be used to *understand* the relationship between the two variables.
Consider again the red-deer regression equation:  
\begin{equation}
   \hat{y}
   = 
   `r RD.b0` 
   - 
    `r abs(RD.b1)` x.
   (\#eq:RedDeerEquation)
\end{equation}
What does this equation reveal about the relationship between $x$ and $y$?


### The meaning of $b_0$

$b_0$ is the *predicted* value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
Using $x = 0$ in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:RedDeerEquation) predicts a mean molar weight of  
\[
  \hat{y} = 4.398 - (0.181\times 0) = 4.398
\]
for deer zero years of age (i.e., newborn male red deer).
This prediction is the predicted *mean* molar weight; some individual deer will have molars weights greater than this, and some less than this.
But in any case, this predicted mean may be nonsense: it is *extrapolating* beyond the data (the youngest deer in the sample is aged $4.4$ years).


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The value of the intercept $b_0$ is sometimes (but not always) meaningless.
The value of the slope $b_1$ is usually of greater interest, as it explains the *relationship* between the two variables.
:::


### The meaning of $b_1$ {#SlopeMeaning}

$b_1$ tells us how much the value of $y$ changes (on average) when the value of $x$ *increases* by one.
For the red-deer data, $b_1$ tells us how much the molar weight changes (on average) when age increases by one year.

Each extra year older is associated with an average change of $`r RD.b1`$ grams in molar weight; that is, a *decrease* in molar weight by a mean of $`r abs(RD.b1)`$\ g.
The molars of some individual deer will lose more weight than this in some years, and some will lose less... the value is a *mean* weight loss per year.

To demonstrate: When $x = 10$, $y$ is predicted to be $\hat{y}= `r RD.b0 + 10 * RD.b1`$\ g.
For deer one year older than this (i.e.\ $x = 11$) we predict $y$ to increase by $b_1 = `r RD.b1`$\ g higher (or, equivalently, $0.181$\ g *lower*).
That is, we would predict $\hat{y}= `r RD.b0 + 10*RD.b1`  - `r abs(RD.b1)` = `r RD.b0 + 11*RD.b1`$\ g.
This is the same prediction made by using $x = 11$ in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:RedDeerEquation).


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
If the value of $b_1$ is *positive*, then the predicted values of $y$ *increase* as the values of $x$ *increase*.
If the value of $b_1$ is *negative*, then the predicted values of $y$ *decrease* as the values of $x$ *increase*.
:::


This interpretation of $b_1$ explains the relationship: Each extra year of age reduces the weight of the molars by $0.181$\ g, on average, in male red deer.
Recall that the units of measurement of the slope here are 'grams per year'.

Observe what happens if the slope is *zero*.
Since $b_1$ is the change in $y$ (on average) when $x$ increase by one, $b_1 = 0$ means that the predicted mean value of $y$ changes by *zero* if the value of $x$ changes by one.
In other words, if the value of $x$ changes, the predicted mean value of $y$ doesn't change.
This is equivalent to saying that there is *no relationship* between the variables.
(We would also find $r = 0$.)


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
If the value of the slope is zero, there is *no linear relationship* between $x$ and $y$.
In this case, the correlation coefficient is also zero.
:::


## Confidence intervals for the regression parameters {#RegressionCI}

### Introduction {#RegressionTests-Intro}

The regression line is computed from the *sample* data, assuming a linear relationship actually exists in the *population*.
The values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ are estimates of the population parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$.

The *sample* estimates can be used to ask questions about the unknown *population* regression coefficients.
As usual, the sample estimates can vary across all possible samples (and so have a *sampling distribution*).

Usually the slope of more interest than the intercept, because the slope explains the  *relationship* between the two variables (Sect.\ \@ref(RegressionForUnderstanding)); however the same ideas apply for the intercept.
The CIs can be obtained from software or computed manually.


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
Using the output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamoviSPSSraw)) for the red-deer data, can you determine the *approximate* $95$% CI for $\beta_1$?\label{thinkBoxCI}
:::

### Describing the sampling distribution {#SamplingDistributionSlopeCI}

The observed value of the slope will vary across all possible samples; *sampling variation* is present.
However, under certain conditions (Sect.\ \@ref(RegressionStatValidity)), the sampling distribution can be described as:

* an approximate normal distribution,
* with a mean of $\beta_1 = 0$, and 
* a standard deviation, called the *standard error of the slope* and denoted $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$.

(A formula exists for finding $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$, but it is tedious to use and we will not give it.)
This distribution describes the possible values of the sample slope, through *sampling variation*.
For the red-deer data then, the values of the sample slope across all possible samples is described (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerSlopeSampDistCI)) as:

* an approximate normal distribution,
* with a sampling mean whose values is $\beta_1 = 0$, and 
* with a standard deviation, called the *standard error of the slope* $\text{s.e.}(b_1) = 0.029$ (from software; Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamoviSPSSraw)).

Most CIs have the form  
\[
  \text{statistic} \pm ( \text{multiplier} \times \text{standard error}),
\]
where the multiplier is $2$ for an approximate $95$% CI (from the 68--95--99.7 rule),.
Using the standard error reported by the software, an approximate 95% CI is $-0.181 \pm (2\times 0.029)$, or $-0.181 \pm 0.058$, or from $-0.239$ to $-0.123$.

Software can be used to produce *exact* CIs too (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamoviSPSSCI)).
The *approximate* and *exact* $95$% CIs are very similar.
We could write:

> The approximate $95$% confidence, for the slope in the regression line explaining molar weight of male red deer from age, is between $-0.239$ to $-0.123$ grams per year.

## Hypothesis testing for the regression parameters {#RegressionHT}

### Statistical hypotheses {#RegressionHypotheses}

The null hypothesis is the usual 'no relationship' hypothesis.
In this context, 'no relationship' means that the slope is zero (Sect.\ \@ref(SlopeMeaning)), so the null hypotheses (about the *population*) is $H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$.

This hypothesis proposes that $\beta_1$ is zero, but $b_1$ is not zero due to sampling variation.
As part of the [decision-making process](#DecisionMaking), the null hypothesis is initially *assumed* to be true.
For the red-deer data (Sect.\ \@ref(RedDeerData)), testing if a relationship exists between the age of the deer and the weight of their molars implies these hypotheses:  
\[
   \text{$H_0$: } \beta_1 = 0;\quad\text{and}\quad\text{$H_1$: } \beta_1 \ne 0.
\]
The parameter is $\beta_1$, the population slope for the regression equation predicting molar weight from age.
The alternative hypothesis is two-tailed, based on the RQ.


```{r}
RD.fitinfo <- summary(RD.lm)$coefficients
RD.t <- RD.fitinfo[, "t value"]
RD.P <- RD.fitinfo[, "Pr(>|t|)"]
```



### Describing the sampling distribution {#SamplingDistributionSlopeHT}

*Assuming* the null hypothesis is true (that $\beta_1 = 0$), the possible values of the sample slope $b_1$ can be described, due to *sampling variation*.
The variation in the sample slope across all possible samples is described (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerSlopeSampDist)) using:

* an approximate normal distribution,
* with a sampling mean whose value is $\beta_1 = 0$ (from $H_0$), and 
* a standard deviation, called the *standard error of the slope* and denoted $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$, with a value of $0.0289$ (from software; Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamoviSPSSCI)).


```{r RedDeerSlopeSampDist, fig.cap="The distribution of sample slopes for the red-deer data, if the population slope is 0", fig.align="center", fig.height=3.5, fig.width=8.25, out.width='85%'}

```


### Computing the test statistic

The *observed* sample slope is $b_1 = -0.181$.
Locating this on Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerSlopeSampDist) (way to the left) shows that it is very unlikely that one of the many possible samples would produce such a slope, just through sampling variation (if the population slope really was $\beta_1 = 0$).
The *test statistic* is found using the usual approach when the sampling distribution has an approximate normal distribution:  
\begin{align*}
   t 
   &= \frac{\text{observed sample slope} - \text{slope sampling mean}}{\text{standard error of the slope}}\\
   &= \frac{ b_1 - \beta_1}{\text{s.e.}(b_1)} \\
   &= \frac{-0.181 - 0}{0.0289} = -6.27,
\end{align*}
where the values of $b_1$ and $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$ are taken from the software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamoviSPSSCI)).
This $t$-score is also reported by the software.


### Determining the $P$-value

To determine if the statistic is *consistent* with the null hypothesis, the $P$-value can be approximated using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule), approximated using tables, or taken from software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerRegressionjamoviSPSSCI)).
Using software, the two-tailed $P$-value is $P < 0.001$.


### Writing conclusions

We write:

> The sample presents very strong evidence ($t = -6.27$; two-tailed $P < 0.001$) that the slope in the population between age of the deer and molar weight is not zero (slope: $-0.181$; $95$% CI from $-0.239$ to $-0.124$).

Notice the three features of writing conclusions again:
An *answer to the RQ*; evidence to support the conclusion ('$t = -6.27$; two-tailed $P < 0.001$); and some *sample summary information* ('slope: $-0.181$; $95$% CI from $-0.239$ to $-0.124$').

::: {.example #EDpatientsRegression name="Emergency department patients"}
For the emergency department data used in Example\ \@ref(exm:EDpatientsCI), the scatterplot of the data and the jamovi output are shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:EDScatterjamovi).
The regression line is estimated as  
\[
  \hat{y} = 150.19 - 0.348x, 
\]
where $y$ represents the mean number of ED patients, and $x$ the number of days since welfare distribution.
This regression equation suggests that each extra day after welfare distribution is associated with a *decrease* in the mean number of ED patients of about 0.35.
It may be easier to understand this way: 

> Each $10$ extra days after welfare distribution is associated with a *decrease* in the number of ED patients of about $10\times 0.35 = 3.5$.

The scatterplot and the regression equation suggests a negative relationship between the number of ED patients and the days after distribution.
However, every sample is likely to be different, so the relationship may not actually be present in the population (the slope may be non-zero due to sampling variation).
We can test this hypothesis:  
\[
   \text{$H_0$: } \beta_1 = 0\quad\text{and}\quad\text{$H_1$: } \beta_1 \ne 0,
\]
where $\beta_1$ is the *population* slope.
The test is two-tailed, based on the authors' aim.
From the output, the test statistic is $t = -7.45$, which is very large; unsurprisingly, the two-tailed $P$-value is very small: $P < 0.001$.
We write:

> Very strong evidence exists ($t = -7.45$; two-tailed $P < 0.001$) of a relationship between the mean number of ED patients and the number of days after welfare distribution (slope: $-0.348$). ADD CI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Statistical validity conditions {#RegressionStatValidity}

The results for the CI and the hypothesis test hold under [certain conditions to be met](#exm:StatisticalValidityAnalogy).
The conditions for which the test is statistically valid are the same as for correlation (Sect.\ \@ref(ValidityCorrelation)):

1. The relationship is approximately linear.
1. The variation in the response variable is approximately constant for all values of the explanatory variable.
1. The sample size is at least $25$.

The sample size of $25$ is a rough figure here, and some books give other values.


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityDeerReg name="Statistical validity"}
For the red-deer data, the relationship is approximately linear, and the variation in molar weight appears to be somewhat constant for various ages
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)),'
} else {
  '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatterHTML)),'

`
so regression is appropriate.
The sample size is $n = 78$.
The results from the hypothesis test should be statistically valid.

* Variation: The variations seems somewhat constant for all values of $x$ (the ONI), but it is a little hard to be sure.
* Sample size: The sample size is larger than $25$.

The conditions for statistical validity appear to have been met.

In a study of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in adults with Down Syndrome [@carvalho2020stop], $n = 60$ adults underwent a sleep study and had various information recorded.
The response variable was OSA severity (measured using the Respiratory Event Index, REI): the average number of episodes of sleep disruption (according to specific criteria) per hour of sleep.
One research question is

> Among Down Syndrome adults, is there a relationship between the REI and neck size?

Here, $x$ is the neck size (in cm), and $y$ is the REI value.

Using the jamovi output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:OSARegressionjamovi)), the correlation coefficient is $r = 0.264$ (and $R$-squared is about $7$%), so the relationship is not very strong.
The value of the slope and $y$-intercept for the regression line in the *sample* are $b_0 = -24.47$ and $b_1 = 1.36$, so the regression equation is   
\[ 
  \hat{y} = -24.47 + 1.36x.
\]
The slope means that for each one centimetre increase in neck circumference, the number of sleep disruptions per hour increase (on average) by about $1.36$.


```{r OSARegressionjamovi, fig.cap="jamovi output for the Obstructive sleep apnoea data", fig.align="center", out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics( "jamovi/OSA/OSARegression.png") 
```


Each sample will produce slightly different *sample* slopes, so we can test to see if the slope in the *population* is non-zero due to sampling variation, using a hypothesis test:  
\[
   \text{$H_0$: } \beta_1 = 0\quad\text{and}\quad\text{$H_1$: } \beta_1 \ne 0\quad \text{(that is, two-tailed)}.
\]
The parameter is $\beta_1$.
From the software output, $t = 2.09$ and the two-tailed $P$-value is $P = 0.041$, so moderate evidence exists that the neck circumference is associated with greater REI.

An *approximate* $95$% CI for the population slope $\beta_1$ is  
\[
   1.3663 \pm (2\times 0.65441),
\]
or from $0.057$ to $2.68$.
From the scatterplot 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:OSAscatter))'
} else {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:OSAscatter2))'
}`
the results appear statistically valid.
We write:

> The sample presents moderate evidence ($t = 2.09$; two-tailed $P = 0.041$) of a relationship between neck circumference and REI (slope: $1.36$; $n = 60$; $95$% CI from $0.057$ to $2.68$) in the population.


## Example: removal efficiency {#RegressionRemovalEfficiency}

In wastewater treatment facilities, air from biofiltration is passed through a membrane and dissolved in water, and is transformed into harmless by-products.
The removal efficiency $y$ (in %) may depend on the inlet temperature (in $^\circ$C; $x$).
A RQ is

> In treating biofiltration wastewater, how does the removal efficiency depend on the inlet temperature?

The scatterplot of the data is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:CorrelationRemovalEfficiency) and software output in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencyjamoviSPSSRegression).
From the output, $b_0 = 97.5$ and $b_1 = 0.0757$, so the regression equation is  
\[
  \hat{y} = 97.5 + 0.0757x
\]
for $x$ and $y$ defined above.
The slope quantifies the relationship, so we can test  
\[
   \text{$H_0$: } \beta_1 = 0 \qquad\text{and}\qquad \text{$H_1$: } \beta_1 \ne 0.
\]
From the output, $t = 10.7$ which is huge; the $P$-value is small as expected: $P < 0.001$. The output does not include the CI, but since $\text{s.e.}(b_1) = 0.00705$, the approximate 95% CI is  
\[
  0.0757 \pm (2 \times 0.00705), \quad\text{ or }\quad 0.0757 \pm 0.0141.
\]
We can write:

> Very strong evidence exists ($t = 10.7$; $P < 0.001$) of a relationship between the inlet temperature and removal efficiency (slope: $0.0757$; approximate $95$% CI: $0.0616$ to $0.0898$).

## Summary {#Chap35-Summary}

In this chapter, we have learnt about **regression**, which mathematically describes the relationship between two *quantitative* variables.
The response variable is denoted by $y$, and the explanatory variable by $x$.
The linear relationship between them (the **regression equation**), in the sample, is  
\[
   \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x,
\]
where $b_0$ is a number (the **intercept**), $b_1$ is a number (the **slope**), and the 'hat' above the $y$ indicates that the equation gives an *predicted* mean value of $y$ for the given $x$ value.

The *intercept* is the predicted mean value of $y$ when the value of $x$ is zero.
The *slope* is how much the predicted mean value of $y$ changes, on average, when the value of $x$ *increases* by $1$.

The regression equation can be used to make *predictions* or to *understand* the relationship between the two variables.
Predictions made with values of $x$ outside the values of $x$ used to create the regression equation (called *extrapolation*) may not be reliable.

In the population, the regression equation is  
\[
   \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x.
\]
To test a hypothesis about a population slope $\beta_1$, based on the value of the sample slope $b_1$, **assume** the value of $\beta_1$ in the null hypothesis (usually zero) to be true.
Then, the sample slope varies from sample to sample and, under certain statistical validity conditions, varies with an approximate normal distribution centred around the hypothesised value of $\beta_1$, with a standard deviation of $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$.
This distribution describes what values of the sample slope could be **expected** in the sample if the value of $\beta_1$ in the null hypothesis was true.

The *test statistic* is  
\[
   t = \frac{ b_1 - \beta_1}{\text{s.e.}(b_1)},
\]
where $\beta_1$ is the hypothesised value given in the null hypothesis (usually zero).
The $t$-value is like a $z$-score, and so an approximate **$P$-value** can be estimated using the  [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule).

**Answers to in-chapter questions:**

* Sect. \ref{thinkBox:Predictions}: $2.23$\ g
* Sect. \ref{thinkBox:RegressionCoefs}: $b_0 = 2.1$ and $b_1 = -0.0047$.
  Remember: $b_1$ is the number multiplied by the $x$, and that $b_0$ is the number by itself.
* Sect. \ref{thinkBoxCI}: Recall that all CIs have the same general form.
* Sect. \ref{thinkBoxRegressionConditions}: The relationship looks approximately linear; the variations seems somewhat constant for all values of $x$ (the ONI), but it is a little hard to be sure. 
  The sample size is larger than $25$. 
  The conditions for statistical validity appear to have been met.
