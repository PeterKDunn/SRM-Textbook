## Introduction: how we know what we know {#HowDoWeKnow}

Scientists once believed that all life regularly and commonly
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'arose spontaneously'
} else {
   '[arose spontaneously](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation)'
}`
from non-living matter.
*Recipes* even existed; for example, van\ Helmont [@data:VanHelmont:Transformations; @pasteur1922generations] gave this
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'recipe'
} else {
   '[recipe](https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/stories/how-to-make-a-mouse-the-bizarre-recipes-borne-of-spontaneous)'
}`
for making a mouse:

> If a soiled shirt is placed in the opening of a vessel containing grains of wheat, the reaction of the leaven in the shirt with fumes from the wheat will, after approximately twenty-one days, transform the wheat into mice.

This was called 'spontaneous generation' (or 'abiogenesis').
We now know this theory is incorrect, but how did the idea emerge?
How was it disproven?
Through *observation* and *research*.

Spontaneous generation was consistent with *observations*: following the above recipe *did* produce mice.
However, the spontaneous generation hypothesis\index{Hypotheses} ('possible explanation') was rejected when later evidence, in better-designed research studies, contradicted the hypothesis.
So, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain the appearance of the mice, which was tested against the evidence, and so on.
Briefly, this is the *evidence-based, scientific process*.\index{Scientific process}

As a more recent example, the dangers of smoking were still being debated into the 1990s:


<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.25\textwidth} -->
<!--   \begin{center} -->
<!--     \includegraphics[width=.20\textwidth]{Illustrations/cigarette-1270516_640.jpg} -->
<!--   \end{center} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->



> ...  a causal role for smoking [has] not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
>
> --- @eysenck1991were, p.\ 429


All scientific knowledge emerges in a similar way: observations lead to hypotheses, which are tested against *evidence*.
If the evidence *contradicts* the hypothesis, the hypothesis is rejected.
If the evidence is *consistent* with the hypothesis, the hypothesis is *temporarily* accepted (until any contradictory evidence emerges, if ever).

Hypotheses not contradicted by large amounts of evidence, over a long time, are sometimes called *laws* or *theories* (such as the 'Law of conservation of energy').
Theories and laws can be disproven if contradictory  evidence emerges.
Knowledge in all scientific disciplines is accumulated using a similar evidence-based process.


## Evidence-based research {#EvidenceBasedResearch}

Every discipline changes, develops, improves, and adapts---usually through *research*.
Your discipline is not the same as it was $10$ years ago; it will change in the next $10$ years.
Scientists, engineers and health practitioners need to know how to understand and adapt to this change.

Remaining current in your discipline requires understanding research, even if you will not be researching yourself.
You still need to know the language, tools, concepts and ideas of research, and you need to be able to critique research.
Research is the foundation of science.

Scientific research systematically answers questions using *data*; that is, science seeks *evidence-based answers*.\index{Evidence-based research}
'Evidence-based research' refers to conclusions based on *evidence*,  rather than hunches, feelings, intuition, hopes, or tradition.
The *evidence* comes from analysing *data*.


::: {.definition #Data name="Data"}
\index{Data}\index{Dataset}
Data refers to information (observations or measurements), such as numbers, labels, recordings, videos, text, etc.

A *dataset* refers to an organised and structured collection of data.
:::


Research involves writing research questions, designing studies to collect data, and analysing data.
This book covers all these components.



## Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research {#TypesOfResearch}

Research can be broadly classified as *qualitative* or *quantitative*.
These are different yet complementary approaches to answering research questions (Table\ \@ref(tab:TypesOfResearch)).\index{Research!qualitative}\index{Research!quantitative}
Both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and can be used together (called *mixed-methods* research).\index{Research!mixed-methods}
The decision to use qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods approaches depends on the purpose of the research.

Briefly, *qualitative research* leads to a deeper understanding, usually for a very narrowly-defined group.
Meanings, motivations, opinions or themes often emerge from qualitative research.
In contrast, *quantitative research* summarises and analyses data usually from large groups, using *numerical* methods, such as averages and percentages. 
In quantitative research, typically information about a large group of interest (a *population*)\index{Population} is found from a subset of the population (a *sample*).\index{Sample}


:::{.example #MixedMethodsInfections name="Types of research"}
The study in Example\ \@ref(Research-in-Action) began by asking a small group of infected people about their recent activities (qualitative research).
This led the researchers to hypothesise that potting mix may have contributed to the cases of  *Legionella longbeachae* infections.
This hypothesis was then tested using a quantitative research study.

::: {.example #BroadTypesOfResearch name="Types of research"}
Suppose we wish to learn about the perceived benefits and barriers for people buying electric vehicles (EVs).

A *qualitative research study* might use two small *focus groups*: one group comprising people who purchased an EV, and another group comprising people who purchased a non-EV.
The researchers ask each group about the reasons for their purchase.

A *quantitative research* study might survey many buyers of EVs and buyers of non-EVs, and ask the buyers' age, sex, and multi-choice questions about the reasons for their purchase.
The survey responses could be analysed by numerically summarising, and comparing, the responses for buyers and non-buyers of EVs.

A *mixed-methods* study may combine both of the above.\index{Research!mixed-methods}
:::


## Example: research in action {#Research-in-Action}

During 1988/1989, an unusually high number of *Legionella longbeachae* infections were observed in South Australians.
The researchers [@data:oconnor:pottingmix] wanted to identify the source to be able to prevent further infections.

The researchers noticed that many of those infected were gardeners who had recently handled potting mix, so they hypothesised that the infection was associated with using potting mix.
They designed a study to test this hypothesis, then collected data from $100$\ people ($25$\ *with* the infection, and $75$\ people of similar age and sex *without* the infection).


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-lukas-296230.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


The researchers classified and summarised the data, then analysed the data to reach an evidence-based conclusion: potting mix was partially, but not solely, responsible for the infections.
The researchers communicated their recommendations to 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'reduce the risks of people contracting the infection in the future.'
} else {
   '[reduce the risks of people contracting the infection in the future](https://www.worksafe.qld.gov.au/safety-and-prevention/hazards/hazardous-exposures/biological-hazards/legionella-risks-from-work-with-potting-mix-and-compost).'

## The steps in research {#SixStepsOfResearch}
\index{Research!six steps}

The research process (for both qualitative and quantitative research) ideally follows the process summarised in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SixSteps), but this is not always possible or practical.
The process is not always linear: researchers may jump from step to step as necessary, and research usually leads to new research questions so that the process starts again.
Nonetheless, each step is important.\index{Research!six steps}


```{r SixSteps, fig.align="center", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=1.8, out.width="40%", fig.cap="The six basic steps in research.", cache=TRUE}
SixSteps(upDirectory = FALSE)  # NOTE ASPECT RATIO: 0.514
``` 


* *Asking* the research question (Chap.\ \@ref(RQs)).
  Research begins with a question to answer.
* *Designing* the study (Chaps.\ \@ref(ResearchDesignOverview) to\ \@ref(Interpretation)).
  Evidence-based research uses data to answer the question.
  A study is designed to obtain that data: determining who or what to study, how to find them, what information to obtain, and ensuring data are obtained ethically.
* *Collecting* the data (Chap.\ \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures)).
  The data collection process must be ethical, reproducible and clearly documented.
* *Classifying* and *summarising* the data (Chaps.\ \@ref(DescribingVars) to\ \@ref(SummariseComments)).
  Before analysis, the data must be classified and summarised to inform the analysis.
  (A computer is useful.) 
* *Analysing* the data (Chaps.\ \@ref(Probability) to\ \@ref(Regression)).
  Analysis refers using the data to find an answer to the research question.
  (A computer is useful.)
* *Reporting* the results (Chaps.\ \@ref(WritingResearch) and\ \@ref(Reading)).
  Communicating the results appropriately, accurately and ethically is important, including identification of any limitations.


## Using computers in research {#Software-In-Research}
\index{Computers and software!in research}

*Statistical* software (such as python, jamovi, R, SAS, SPSS, Stata, etc.) is useful for summarising and analysing data.\index{Computers and software!statistical}
Statistical software:

* is designed for working with large datasets.
* encourages reproducible research (Sect.\ \@ref(ReproducibleResearch)).\index{Research!reproducibility}
* allows high-precision formatting and graphics.
* is powerful; with some programming skills, almost anything is possible.
* is specifically designed for analysing and working with data.


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"} 
This book sometimes shows output from jamovi [@Software:jamovi], but using jamovi is *not* essential for understanding this book.\index{Computers and software!jamovi}
:::


Using spreadsheets\index{Computers and software!spreadsheets} in research for storing and analysing data requires care; extremely expensive and dangerous errors have been made due to using spreadsheets [@altarawneh2017pilot]:

<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/students-1807505_640.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


  
* Spreadsheets may *change data* (e.g., reformatting entries as dates) when not appropriate [@ziemann2016gene].
* Spreadsheets may include *formulas with errors* that are *difficult to locate* and hence fix [@panko2016we; @Retraction:London:Excel].
* Spreadsheets *do not leave a record* of how the data were analysed or prepared.
  Keeping a record of the analysis, preparation of variables, and other operations with the data is good scientific practice (*reproducible research*; see Sect.\ \@ref(ReproducibleResearch)) [@simons2019reproducible].
* Spreadsheets often produce poor graphs [@su2008s].
<!-- * Excel has *bugs* [@keeling2004numerical; @melard2014accuracy] even in basic operations [@berger2007nonstandard; @hargreaves2010polynomial]. -->
<!--   Sometimes these errors are made worse after company attempts to fix them [@mccullough2002accuracy]. -->

Problems with spreadsheets, as with any software, are often due to human error, but *spreadsheets make errors hard to find and fix*. 
Spreadsheets are useful for data collection and basic data manipulation, but are not designed for scientific analysis.
Be careful using spreadsheets for research and analysis.


<!-- :::{.example} -->
<!-- @zeeberg2004mistaken found Excel was corrupting data files used in genetic analysis (p. 1): -->

<!-- > The date conversions affect at least 30 gene names; the floating-point conversions affect at least 2,000 [...]  -->
<!-- > These conversions are irreversible; the original gene names cannot be recovered. -->
