## Introduction {#TwoQuant-Intro}

So far, RQs about single variables and RQs for comparing two groups have been studied.
In this chapter, the relationship between two quantitative variables is studied; that is, correlational RQs.\index{Research question!correlational}

Scatterplots display the relationship between *two quantitative variables*.
Conventionally, and when appropriate, the response variable is shown on the vertical axis (and denoted $y$), and the explanatory variable is shown on the horizontal axis (and denoted $x$).\index{Variables!response}\index{Variables!explanatory}
Two quantitative variables are measured on each individual, and a point is placed on the scatter plot for each individual at the values of the two variables.
In some cases, only a simple relationship is being explored, and which variable is denoted $x$ and which is $y$ is not important (for example, see Exercise \@ref(exr:CorTestDogs).)

As with any graph, describing the message in the graph is important, because the purpose of a graph is to display the information in the clearest, simplest possible way.


:::{.example #RedDeer name="Red-deer data"}
@data:Holgate1965:StraightLine examined the relationship between the age of $n = 78$ male red deer and the weight of their molars.
The data 
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:RedDeerData))'
} else {
  '(below)'
}`
comprises two *quantitative* variables, and both measurements are made on the same individuals (i.e., male red deer).

The scatterplot (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)) shows one dot for each deer (individual).
The response variable is the molar weight, which is on the vertical axis and denoted $y$.
The explanatory variable is the deer age, which is on the horizontal axis and denoted $x$.

For instance, one deer is just over $2$ years of age (so $x$ has a value a bit larger than $2$), and has a molar weight of $2.42$\ g (so that $y = 2.42$).
This is the first deer listed in 
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  'Table\\ \\@ref(tab:RedDeerData).'
} else {
  'the data above.'
}`

## Describing scatterplots {#UnderstandingScatterplots}
\index{Scatterplot}

The purpose of a graph is to facilitate *understanding* of the data (Sect.\ \@ref(GraphsConstructing)).
For a scatterplot, the *form*, *direction*, and *variation in the relationship* (or the *strength of the relationship*) are described:

1. *Form*: The overall *form* or structure of the relationship (e.g., linear; curved upwards; etc.).\index{Scatterplots!form}
2. *Direction*: The *direction* of the relationship (sometimes not relevant if the relationship is non-linear):\index{Scatterplots!direction}
    - A *positive* association exists if *high* values of one variable accompany *high* values of the other variable, in general.
    - A *negative* association exists if *high* values of one variable accompany *low* values of the other variable, in general.
3. *Variation*: The amount of *variation* in the relationship.\index{Scatterplots!variation}\index{Scatterplots!strength}
   A small amount of variation in the response variable for given values of the explanatory variable means the relationship is strong; a lot of variation in the response variable for given values of the explanatory variable means the relationship is less strong.
   Describing the variation is difficult; an objective, numerical way to do so is explained in Sect.\ \@ref(CorrelationR2).

Anything unusual or noteworthy should also be discussed.
These features explain the *type* of relationship (*form*; *direction*), and the *strength* of that relationship (*variation*).
Examples are shown in
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  'the carousel below (click to move through the scatterplots).'
} else {
  'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ScatterplotDescriptionExamples).'
}`


```{r, child = if (knitr::is_html_output())  'children/ScatterExampleCarousel.Rmd'}

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)),'
} else {
   '(Fig\\. \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)),'
}`
the relationship is approximately linear (form) with a negative direction (*older* deer generally have *lighter* teeth); the *variation* is... perhaps moderate.

A study [@data:Tager:FEV; @BIB:data:FEV] measured the lung capacity of children in Boston (using forced expiratory volume, FEV, in litres).
The scatterplot (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:FEVscatter)) is curved (*form*), where older children have larger FEVs, in general (*direction*).
The *variation* in FEV gets larger for taller youth.

## Summarising the relationship: correlation and $R^2$ {#CorrelationR2}

### Correlation coefficients {#CorrCoefficients}
\index{Scatterplots!form}\index{Correlation}\index{Correlation coefficient}

In general, summarising the relationship between two quantitative variables is difficult, because the possible relationships vary greatly
 (consider 
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  'the scatterplots shown in the carousel above).'
} else {
  'the scatterplots shown in Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ScatterplotDescriptionExamples)).'
}`
However, if we focus only on *linear* relationships, the best way to summarise the relationship between the variables is to use a correlation coefficient.
Each variable can also be numerically summarised.

The *Pearson* correlation coefficient measures the *strength* and *direction* of the *linear* relationship between two quantitative variables^[Other correlation coefficients also exist, such as the *Spearman* correlation, which may be used for increasing-only or decreasing-only  non-linear relationships.].
Pearson correlation coefficients only apply if the form is approximately *linear*, so checking the scatterplot first is important.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The Pearson correlation coefficient only makes sense if the relationship is approximately linear.
:::


In the *population*, the unknown value of the correlation coefficient is denoted $\rho$ ('rho'); in the *sample* the value of the correlation coefficient is denoted $r$.
As usual, $r$ (the *statistic*) is an estimate of $\rho$ (the *parameter*), and the value of $r$ is likely to be different in every sample (that is, *sampling variation* exists).


:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}

::: {style="display: flex;"}
The symbol $\rho$ is the Greek letter 'rho', pronounced 'row', as in 'row your boat'.
:::

::: {}
```{r}
htmltools::tags$video(src = "./Movies/rho.mp4",

```

The values of $\rho$ and $r$ are *always* between $-1$ and $+1$.
The *sign* indicates whether the relationship has a positive or negative linear association, and the *value* of the correlation coefficient describes the *strength* of the relationship:

* $r = -1$ means a *perfect, negative* relationship:\index{Correlation coefficient!positive}
  knowing the value of $x$ produces a perfect prediction of the value of $y$, and *larger* values of $y$ are associated with *smaller* values of $x$.
* Values of $r$ between $-1$ and $0$ mean a *negative* relationship:\index{Correlation coefficient!negative}
  knowing the value of $x$ produces a prediction of the value of $y$, and *larger* values of $y$ are associated with *smaller* values of $x$ (in general).
* $r = 0$ means *no linear relationship* between the variables:\index{Correlation coefficient!zero}
  Knowing how the value of $x$ changes tells us nothing about how the corresponding value of $y$ changes.
  The best prediction for *any* value of $x$ is the mean of $y$.
* Values of $r$ between $0$ and $+1$ mean a *positive* relationship:
  knowing the value of $x$ produces a prediction of the value of $y$, and *larger* values of $y$ are associated with *larger* values of $x$ (in general).
* $r = +1$ means a *perfect, positive* relationship:
  knowing the value of $x$ produces a perfect prediction of the value of $y$, and *larger* values of $y$ are associated with *larger* values of $x$.

Most values of $r$ are between the extremes of $r = -1$ and $r = +1$.

Numerous example scatterplots were shown in Sect.\ \@ref(UnderstandingScatterplots).
A correlation coefficient is not relevant for 
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  'Plots C, D, E or H,'
} else {
  'Plots C, D or E,'
}`
as those relationships are not linear.
For the others:

* *Plot A*: the correlation coefficient will be *positive*, and reasonably near one.
* *Plot B*: the correlation coefficient will be *negative*, but not near $-1$.
* *Plot F*: the correlation coefficient will close to zero.


::: {.example #Correlations name="Correlation coefficients"}
@leuchtenberger2022effects and @Nishizaki2022SanddollarData explored the relationship between water temperature and fertilization rates for sand dollars (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SanddollarsPlot)).
The correlation coefficient is $r = -0.49$ (left panel), which might suggest that *higher* temperatures result in *lower* fertilization rates.
However, a *curved* relationship is apparent (right panel), and so the relationship is more involved: the fertilization rate increases up to about 18^o^C, and then starts falling again.

A Pearson correlation coefficient is not suitable for describing the relationship.

Formulas exist to compute the value of $r$, but are tedious to use manually.
We will used software to obtain values of $r$.


::: {.example #CorrelationsDeer name="Correlation coefficients"}
For the red-deer data 
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)),'
} else {
  '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)),'
}
`
the relationship is approximately linear, and the output from jamovi shows that $r = -0.584$ (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerCorrelationjamovi)).
The value of $r$ is *negative* because, in general, *older* deer ($x$) are associated with *smaller* weight molars ($y$).
The relationship may be described as 'moderately strong'.
:::


::: {.example #LungCapCor name="Correlation coefficients"}
@data:Tager:FEV studied the lung capacity (forced expiratory volume; FEV) of children in Boston [@BIB:data:FEV].
The scatterplot in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:FEVscatter) is not linear, so a correlation coefficient is inappropriate.

In addition, the variation in the FEV increases as children get taller.
For instance, the variation in FEV for children about $50$\ cm tall is much smaller than the variation in FEV for children about $70$\ cm tall.

### R-squared ($R^2$) {#R2}
\index{R2@$R^2$}

$r$ describes the strength and direction of the linear relationship, but knowing exactly what the value *means* is tricky.
Interpretation is easier using $R^2$, or 'R-squared': the square of the value of $r$.
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
   'The animation below shows some values of $R^2$.'
}`


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The value of $R^2$ is *never* negative, and is usually multiplied by $100$ and expressed as a percentage.
:::


<!-- need to watch! Unfortunate line breaks can happen! -->
::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"} 
The value of $R^2$ is never negative!
However, you need to be careful using your calculator.
On most calculators, entering `-0.5^2` returns an answer of `-0.25`.
The calculator interprets your input as meaning `-(0.5^2)`.

Use brackets; `(-0.5)^2` gives the correct answer of `0.25`.

$R^2$ measures the reduction in the unexplained variation in values of $y$ because the value of $x$ is known.
If the values of $x$ are unknown, the best summary of the $y$-values is the mean of the $y$-values.

However, a relationship between the values of $x$ and $y$ suggests we (potentially) can make better estimates of the value of $y$ by knowing the value of $x$.
That means that less variation should be unexplained.
When expressed as a percentage, $R^2$ measures how much the unexplained variation reduces due to our knowledge of the linear relationship.
If $R$-squared is zero, then the amount of unexplained variation has not reduced at all, and exploring the relationship has no value.


:::{.example #ReductionR2 name="Unknown variation in $y$"}
\index{R2@$R^2$!meaning}
For the red-deer data, the unexplained variation in the values of $y$ (molar weight), without knowing anything about the age of the deer, is the variation in the *distances from the mean* to each observation (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerR2), left panels).
Effectively, the unexplained variation is the standard deviation of the molar weights ($s = 0.7263$).

If the age of the deer ($x$) is used, the unexplained variation in the values of $y$ is now the variation in the *distances from the line explaining the relationship* to each observation (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RedDeerR2), right panel).
The distances are much shorter, in general, showing a decrease in the *unexplained* variation.
Effectively, the unexplained variation is the standard deviation of the distance from the line to the observations ($s = 0.5895$).

Hence, the reduction in the *square* of the standard deviations is $(0.7263^2 - 0.5895^2)/0.7263^2 = 0.341$, or $34.1$\%.
This is the value of $R^2$.

::: {.example #R2Deer name="Values of $R$-squared"}
For the red-deer data
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)),'
} else {
  '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)),'
}`
the value of $R^2$ is $R^2 = (-0.584)^2 = 0.341$, usually written as a percentage: $34.1$%.
The value of $R^2$ is positive, even though the value of $r$ is negative.

This means a reduction of about $34.1$% in the unknown variation of the molar weights, due to using the information in the age of the deer.
The rest of the variation in molar weights is due to chance, and to extraneous variables, such as weight, diet, amount of exercise, genetics, etc.

## Numerical summary tables {#ConnectionSummaryTables}
\index{Quantitative data!correlations!summary tables}

In general, numerically summarising the relationship between two quantitative variables is difficult because of the many types of possible relationships (Sect.\ \@ref(UnderstandingScatterplots)).
However, for *linear* relationships, both quantitative variables can be summarised plus the correlation coefficient (Table\ \@ref(tab:RDSummaryTable)).

## Chapter summary {#TwoQuant-Summary}

A *scatterplot* displays the relationship between two quantitative variables (the response denoted $y$; the explanatory denoted $x$).
The relationship is described by the *form* (linear, or otherwise), the *direction* of the relationship (sometimes not relevant if the graph is not linear), and the *variation* in the relationship (or the *strength* of the relationship).
Linear relationship are measured numerical using the correlation coefficients and $R^2$.
