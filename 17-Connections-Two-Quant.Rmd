## Introduction: red deer {#TwoQuant-Intro}

So far, RQs about single variables and RQs for comparing two groups have been studied.
Comparing the mean value of a quantitative variable in two groups was studied in Sects.\ \@ref(CITwoMeans) and\ \@ref(TestTwoMeans).
Comparing the odds of an outcome of interest in two groups was studied in Sects.\ \@ref(OddsRatiosCI) and\ \@ref(TestsOddsRatio).
In this chapter, the relationship between two quantitative variables is studied.

Our main example is a study [@data:Holgate1965:StraightLine] examining the relationship between the age of $n = 78$ male red deer and the weight of their
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  'molars (Table\\ \\@ref(tab:deerData)).'
} else {
  'molars; the data are shown below.'
}
`
The data comprises two quantitative variables.


```{r deerDataDT, fig.cap="The male red deer data", fig.align="center"}
data(RedDeer)

if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
  DT::datatable(RedDeer,
              list(scrollX = TRUE, 
	            scrollY = TRUE, 
		          ordering = FALSE),
              caption = "The male red deer data")
}
```

## Graphs {#Scatterplots}

<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">

</div>


For the red deer data, both variables are *quantitative*, so the appropriate graphical summary (Sect.\ \@ref(Scatterplots)) is a *scatterplot* 
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)).'
} else {
  '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RedDeerScatterHTML)).'
}
`
The *response* variable is graphed on the *vertical* axis, and denoted $y$; the *explanatory* variable is graphed on the *horizontal* axis,
and denoted $x$.
In some cases, when only a relationship is being explored, which variable is $x$ and which is $y$ is not important (for example, see Sect.\ \@ref(CorTestDogs).)

The *explanatory* variable (potentially) partially *explains* the response variable.
In this example, the age of the deer may partially explain the weight of the molars (supposing the weight of the molars partially explains the age of the deer is silly), so

* The *explanatory variable* ($x$) is the age of the deer (in years), and
* The *response variable* ($y$) is the weight of molars (in grams).

Each row in the dataset (and each point on the scatterplot) corresponds to a single deer (the units of analysis); two quantitative variables (age; molar weight) are measured on each deer.

## Understanding scatterplots {#UnderstandingScatterplots}

The purpose of a graph is to facilitate *understanding* of the data (Sect.\ \@ref(GraphsConstructing)).
For a scatterplot, the *form*, *direction*, and *variation in the relationship* (or the *strength of the relationship*) are described:

1. *Form*: The overall *form* or structure of the relationship (e.g., linear; curved upwards; etc.).
2. *Direction*: The *direction* of the relationship (sometimes not relevant if the relationship is non-linear):
    - The variables are *positively* associated if *high* values of one variable accompany *high* values of the other variable, in general.
    - The variables are *negatively* associated if *high* values of one variable accompany *low* values of the other variable, in general.
3. *Variation*: The amount of *variation* in the relationship.
   A small amount of variation in the response variable for given values of the explanatory variable means the relationship is strong; a lot of variation in the response variable for given values of the explanatory variable means the relationship is less strong.
   Describing the variation is difficult; an objective, numerical way to do so is explained in Chap.\ \@ref(Correlation).

Anything unusual or noteworthy should also be discussed.
These three features explain the *type* of relationship (*form*; *direction*), and the *strength* of that relationship (*variation*).
Examples are shown in

  'the carousel below (click to move through the scatterplots).'

A study [@data:Tager:FEV; @BIB:data:FEV] measured the lung capacity of children in Boston (using forced expiratory volume, FEV, in litres).
The scatterplot (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:FEVscatter)) is curved (*form*), where older children have larger FEVs, in general (*direction*).
The *variation* gets larger for taller youth.

## Summary tables {#ConnectionSummaryTables}

In general, numerical summaries are difficult for describing the relationship between two quantitative variables, because the possible relationships vary greatly (Sect.\ \@ref(UnderstandingScatterplots)).
Later (Chap.\ \@ref(LinearRelationshipsR)), numerical summaries are described specifically for *linear* relationships.

Nonethless, numerical summary information the relationship between *two quantitative variables* can be collated in a table.
The table summarises each variable.
If the relationship is linear, the measures described in Chap.\ \@ref(LinearRelationshipsR) may also be added to the summary table.

## Chapter summary {#TwoQuant-Summary}

A *scatterplot* displays the relationship between two quantitative variables (the response denoted $y$; the explanatory denoted $x$).
The relationship is described by the *form* (linear, or otherwise), the *direction* of the relationship (sometimes not relevant if the graph is not linear), and the *variation* in the relationship (or the *strength* of the relationship).
