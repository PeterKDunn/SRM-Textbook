## Introduction: lifespan of dog breeds {#Chap33-Intro}
\index{Correlation}

So far, RQs about single variables (descriptive\ RQs) and RQs for comparisons (relational and repeated-measures\ RQs) have been studied.
In this chapter, the relationship between two quantitative variables is studied (correlational\ RQs) *when that relationship is approximately linear*.

Consider the average lifespan and average weight of numerous dog breeds.
@da2023dog recorded the average lifespan and average weight of at least\ $50$ dogs of numerous dog breeds [@da2023dogDATA].
The dog breed is the unit of analysis,\index{Unit of analysis} and the individual dog is the unit of observation\index{Unit of observation}
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:DogsLifeData)).'
} else {
  '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:dogslifeDataDT).'
}`
The data comprises two quantitative variables; the scatterplot is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeScatter2).\index{Graphs!scatterplot}

     data = DogsLife,

     xlab = "Weight (in kg)",
     ylab = "Lifespan (in years)")
# with(DogsLife,
#      cor(Lifespan , Weight) )
```


Knowing the breed-weight seems to provide some information about the lifespan; that is, a relationship between the variables seems evident.
Furthermore, the relationship seems somewhat *linear*, and the *correlation coefficient* (shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeCorrelationjamovi))\index{Correlation coefficient (Pearson)} is $r = -0.712$.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Recall that the *sample* correlation coefficient is denoted by\ $r$, and the *population* correlation coefficient is denoted by\ $\rho$,

knitr::include_graphics("jamovi/DogsLife/DogsLifeCorrelation.png")
```


Only one of the countless possible samples of dogs have been studied, and the value of\ $r$ (an estimate of $\rho$, the *parameter*) will vary from sample to sample.
That is, the value of\ $r$ has a sampling distribution, and sampling variation exists.\index{Sampling variation}
The sampling distribution of\ $r$, however, does *not* have a normal distribution, so CIs for $\rho$ will not be discussed (indeed, software does not always provide a CI for $\rho$).

## Correlation: hypothesis test for $\rho$ {#CorrelationTesting}
\index{Hypothesis testing!correlation coefficient}

A correlational RQ can be asked about the relationship between the variables in the *population*, as measured by the unknown *population* (Pearson) correlation coefficient:\index{Correlation}

> In the population, is there a linear relationship between the value of\ $y$ and the value of\ $x$?

In the context of the dog-breed data, the RQ is:

> In dog breeds, is there a linear relationship between weight and lifespan?

This is a two-tailed RQ.\spacex
Clearly, the *sample* correlation coefficient $r$ for the data is not zero, and the RQ is effectively asking if sampling variation is the reason for this discrepancy.
The null hypothesis is:

* $H_0$: $\rho = 0$.

The parameter is $\rho$, the *population* correlation coefficient.
This null hypothesis is the 'no relationship' position, which proposes that the population correlation coefficient is zero, and the sample correlation coefficient is not zero due to sampling variation.
The alternative hypothesis is:

* $H_1$:  $\rho \ne 0$ \quad (*two-tailed* test, based on the RQ).

As usual, initially *assume* that $\rho = 0$ (from\ $H_0$), then describe what values of\ $r$ could be *expected* using the *sampling distribution*, under that assumption, across all possible samples (sampling variation).
Then the *observed* value of\ $r$ is compared to the expected values to determine if the value of\ $r$ supports or contradicts the assumption.

For a correlation coefficient, the sampling distribution of\ $r$ does not have a normal distribution^[For those interested: the value of\ $r$ only varies between $-1$ and $1$, so cannot have a normal distribution. A transformation of\ $r$ *does* exist that has an approximate normal distribution and *standard error*.], and software output usually does not provide a standard error, so we will not discuss CIs for the correlation coefficient.

However, the output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeCorrelationjamovi))\index{Software output!correlation} contains the relevant $P$-value for the $t$-test.
The *two*-tailed $P$-value for the test is less than\ $0.0001$.
*Very strong evidence* exists to support\ $H_1$ (that the correlation in the population is less than zero).
We write:

> The sample presents very strong evidence (two-tailed $P < 0.0001$) that the average lifespan decreases as the breed-weight increases ($r = -0.712$; $n = 73$) in the population.

Notice the three features of writing conclusions again:
An *answer to the RQ*; evidence to support the conclusion ('two-tailed $P < 0.0001$'; here no value for the test statistic is given in the output); and some *sample summary information* ('$r = -0.712$; $n = 73$').




::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The evidence suggests that the correlation coefficient is *not zero* (in the population).
However, a *non-zero* correlation doesn't necessarily mean a *strong* correlation exists.
The correlation may be weak in the population (as estimated by the value of\ $r$), but evidence exists that the correlation is *not zero* in the *population*.

That is, the test is about statistical significance, not practical importance.\index{Practical importance}

## Regression

### Introducting regression {#Chap35-Intro}

*Correlation* measures the *strength* and *direction* of the *linear* relationship between two quantitative variables\ $x$ (an explanatory variable) and\ $y$ (a response variable).
Sometimes, however, knowing *what* the relationship is proves useful.
This is called *regression*.

The regression relationship, described mathematically using an *equation*, allows us to:

1. *Predict* the mean value of\ $y$ from given values of\ $x$ (Sect.\ \@ref(RegressionForPrediction)); and
2. *Understand* the relationship between\ $x$ and\ $y$ (Sect.\ \@ref(RegressionForUnderstanding)).

<!-- Of course, any prediction will not be a perfect prediction, due to natural variation in the data.\index{Natural variation} -->
<!-- In other words, for any given value of $x$, many possible values of $y$ could be observed. -->
<!-- This means that the prediction is actually a prediction of the *mean* of all the possible values of $y$ that could be observed for that given value of $x$. -->

An example of a linear regression equation, describing the relationship between the observed values of an explanatory variable\ $x$ and the observed values of a response variable\ $y$, is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{y} = -4  + (2\times x), \qquad\text{usually written}\qquad \hat{y} = -4  + 2x.
  (\#eq:ExampleRegressionEqn)
\end{equation}
The notation\ $\hat{y}$ refers to the mean of all the $y$-values that could be observed for some given value of\ $x$.
That is, for some value of\ $x$, many values of\ $y$ could be observed, and\ $\hat{y}$ is the value that regression equation predicts as the *mean* of all those possible values. 


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
$y$\ refers to the values of the response variable observed from individuals.
$\hat{y}$ refers to *mean predicted* value of\ $y$ for given values of\ $x$.
:::

Equation\ \@ref(eq:ExampleRegressionEqn) can be used to explore the relationship between the variables.
For instance, suppose $x = 7$; then the equation gives
$$
  \hat{y} = -4 + (2\times 7) = -4 + 14 = 10.
$$
This means that, when the value of\ $x$ is\ $7$, the observed values of\ $y$ will vary around a predicted mean of $\hat{y} = 10$.

:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}
$\hat{y}$ is pronounced as 'why-hat'; the 'caret' above the\ $y$ is called a 'hat'.
:::


More generally, the equation of a straight line is
$$
   \hat{y} = b_0 + (b_1 \times x), \qquad\text{usually written}\qquad \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x,
$$
where\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ are (unknown) numbers estimated from sample data.
Notice that\ $b_1$ is the number multiplied by\ $x$.
In Eq.\ \@ref(eq:ExampleRegressionEqn), $b_0 = -4$ and $b_1 = 2$.


::: {.example #RegressionGirlsHt name="Regression equations"}
A report on the growth of Australian children [@data:AustralianGirls] found an approximate linear relationship between the age of girls in years $x$ and their height (in\ cm)\ $y$ for girls between four and seven years-of-age.
The regression equation was approximately
$$
   \hat{y} = 73 + 7x.
$$
The regression equation is the same when written as
$$
   \hat{y} = 7x + 73.
$$
In both cases, $b_0 = 73$ and $b_1 = 7$.

The regression equation can be used to *predict* the *mean* height for any given age\ $x$.
For example, girls aged five years-of-age (i.e., $x = 5$) are predicted to have a mean height of 
$$
   \hat{y} = 73 + (7\times 5) = 73 + 35 = 108.
$$
The heights of girls will vary around a *mean* height of\ $108$\cms; some individual girls aged five will be taller than\ $108$\cms, and some will be shorter than\ $108$\cms.

### Reviewing linear equations {#RegressionEquationsReview}
\index{Linear equations}\index{Regression}

To introduce, or revise, the idea of a linear equation, consider the (artificial) data in 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterLATEX) (left panel),'
} else {
   'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterHTML),'
}`
with an explanatory variable\ $x$ and a response variable\ $y$.\index{Response variable}\index{Explanatory variable}\index{Graphs!scatterplot}
In the graph, a sensible line is drawn on the graph that seems to capture the relationship between\ $x$ and\ $y$.
(You may have drawn a slightly different line.)
The line describes the predicted mean values of\ $y$ for various values of\ $x$.

A *regression equation* specifies the line.\index{Regression!equation}
In the regression equation $\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x$, the numbers\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ are called *regression coefficients*,\index{Regression!coefficients} where

* $b_0$ is the *intercept* or the *$y$-intercept*,\index{Regression!equation!intercept}\index{Linear equations!intercept}
  whose value corresponds to the *predicted* mean value of\ $y$ when $x = 0$.
* $b_1$ is the *slope*,\index{Regression!equation!slope}\index{Linear equations!slope}
  whose value measures how much the value of\ $y$ changes, on average, when the value of\ $x$ *increases* by\ $1$.

We will use software to find the values of\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ (the formulas are tedious to use).
However, a rough approximation of the value of\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ can be obtained using the rough straight line drawn on the scatterplot
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterLATEX)).'
} else {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterHTML)).'
}`

A rough approximation of the value of the *intercept*\ $b_0$ is the value of\ $\hat{y}$ when $x = 0$, from the drawn line.
When $x = 0$, the regression line suggests the value of\ $\hat{y}$ is about\ $2$
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(left panel)'
}`; 
that is, the value of\ $b_0$ is approximately\ $2$.

A rough approximation of the *slope*\ $b_1$ is\index{Regression!equation!rise over run}
\begin{equation}
     \frac{\text{Change in $y$}}{\text{Corresponding \emph{increase} in $x$}}
   = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}
   (\#eq:RiseOverRun)
\end{equation}
from the drawn line.
This approximation of the slope is the *change* in the value of\ $y$ (the 'rise') divided by the corresponding *increase* in the value of\ $x$ (the 'run').

Consider what happens in 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:ExampleScatterLATEX) (right panel)'
} else {
   'the animation below'
}`
when the value of\ $x$ increases from\ $1$ to\ $5$ (an *increase* of $5 - 1 = 4$).
The corresponding values of\ $y$ change from about\ $5$ to about\ $17$, a change (specifically, an *increase*) of $17 - 5 = 12$.
So, using Eq.\ \@ref(eq:RiseOverRun),
$$
   \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} 
   = \frac{17 - 5}{5 - 1}
   = \frac{12}{4} 
   = 3.
$$
The value of\ $b_1$ is about\ $3$.
When using 'rise-over-run', better guesses for\ $b_1$ are found when using one value of\ $x$ near the left-side of the scatterplot, and another value of\ $x$ near the right-side of the scatterplot.

Combing the rough guesses for $b_0$ and $b_1$, the regression line is approximately $\hat{y} = 2 + (3\times x)$, usually written
$$
  \hat{y} = 2 + 3x.
$$

::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The regression equation has\ $\hat{y}$ (not\ $y$) on the left-hand side.
That is, the equation *predicts* the *mean* values of\ $y$, which may not be equal to the observed values (which are denoted by\ $y$).

A 'good' regression equation would produce predicted values\ $\hat{y}$ close to the observed values\ $y$; that is, the line passes close to each point on the scatterplot.\index{Graphs!scatterplot}
:::


The *intercept*\ $b_0$ has the same measurement units as the response variable.\index{Regression!equation!intercept}
The measurement unit for the *slope*\ $b_1$ is the 'measurement units of the response variable', per 'measurement units of the explanatory variable'.\index{Regression!equation!intercept}


:::{.example name="Measurement units of regression parameters"}
In Example\ \@ref(exm:RegressionGirlsHt), the regression line for the relationship between the age of Australian girls in years\ $x$ and their height (in\ cm)\ $y$ was $\hat{y} = 73 + 7x$ (for girls between four and seven years).

In this equation, the intercept is $b_0 = 73$\cms and the slope is $b_1 = 73$\cms/year.
:::


:::{.example name="A rough approximation of the regression equation"}
For the dog-breed data (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeScatter2)), a rough estimate of the regression line can be drawn on a scatterplot to estimate\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogBreedRiseRun)).
The estimate of\ $b_0$ (the value of\ $y$ when $x = 0$) is roughly\ $13.5$.

The estimate of\ $b_1$ can be found using the 'rise-over-run' idea.
When $x = 0$, the value of\ $\hat{y}$ (according to the drawn line) is about\ $13.5$.
At the other extreme of the plot, where $x = 80$, the value of\ $y$ is\ $5.5$.
(Any two points on the line can be used, but using two points at each end gives better guesses of the slope.)
So, as\ $x$ increases from\ $0$ to about\ $80$, the value of\ $\hat{y}$ *reduces* from about\ $13.5$ to about\ $5.5$, a drop of about\ $-8$.
That is, for a 'run' of $80 - 0 = 80$, the 'rise' is $5.5 - 13.5 = -8$ (i.e., a drop of\ $8$), and so a rough estimate of the slope is $-8/80 = -0.1$.\index{Regression!equation!rise over run}
(The relationship is *negative*, so the slope is *negative*.)

The rough guess of the regression line is therefore
$$
  \hat{y} = 13.5 - 0.1x,
$$
where\ $x$ is the weight (in\ kgs), and\ $y$ is lifespan (in\ years).
The rough guess of the intercept\ $b_0$ is\ $13.5$\ys, while the rough guess of the slope\ $b_1$ is\ $-0.1$\ys/\kgs.

The relationship between the number of cyclones\ $y$ in the Australian region each year from\ 1969 to\ 2005, and a climatological index called the *Ocean `r readr::parse_character( c("Niño"), locale=locale(encoding="UTF-8"))` Index* (ONI,\ $x$), is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ONIcyclones) [@mypapers:dunnsmyth:glms].

When the value of\ $x$ is zero, the predicted value of\ $y$ is about\ $12$, so\ $b_0$ is about\ $12$.
Notice that the intercept is the *predicted* value of\ $y$ when $x = 0$, which is *not* at the left of the graph in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ONIcyclones).

To approximate the value of\ $b_1$, use the 'rise-over-run' idea.\index{Regression!equation!rise over run}
When\ $x$ is about\ $-2$, the predicted mean value of\ $y$ is about\ $17$; when\ $x$ is about\ $2$, the predicted mean value of\ $y$ is about\ $8$.
The value of\ $x$ increases by $2 - (-2) = 4$,  while the value of\ $y$ changes by $8 - 17 = -9$ (a *decrease* of about $9$).
Hence,\ $b_1$ is approximately $-9/4 = -2.25$.
(You may get something slightly different.)

The relationship has a *negative* direction, so the slope must be *negative*.
The regression line is approximately $\hat{y} = 12 - 2.25x$.

The above method gives a crude approximation to the values of the intercept\ $b_0$ and the slope\ $b_1$.
In practice, *many* reasonable lines could be drawn through a scatterplot of data, each giving slightly different rough guesses for\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$.
However, one of those lines is the 'best' line in some sense^[For those interested: The 'line of best fit' is the line for which the sum of the *squared* vertical distances between the observations\ $y$ and the predicted values\ $\hat{y}$ (i.e, the regression line) is as small as possible.].
Software calculates this 'line of best fit'.\index{Regression!equation!line of best fit}

## Regression: finding equations using software {#Regression-Software}
\index{Regression!equation!using software}\index{Software output!regression}

```{r}
DB.lm <- lm(Lifespan ~ Weight, 
            data = DogsLife)
DB.b0 <- round( coef(DB.lm)[1], 3)
DB.b1 <- round( coef(DB.lm)[2], 3)
```


Software is almost always used to find the 'best' estimates for the intercept\ $b_0$ and slope\ $b_1$, as the formulas are complicated and tedious to use.
For the dog-breed data (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeScatter2)), the relevant software output is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeRegression).

In the output, the values of\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ are in the column labelled `Estimate`; the value of the sample $y$-intercept is $b_0 = `r DB.b0`$, and the value of the sample *slope* is $b_1 = `r DB.b1`$.
These are the values of the two *regression coefficients*.\index{Regression!coefficients}
The regression equation is, after rounding
\begin{equation}
	\hat{y} = `r DB.b0` + (`r DB.b1`\times x),
	\qquad\text{usually written as}\qquad  
	\hat{y} = `r DB.b0` - `r abs(DB.b1)` x.
  (\#eq:RedDeerRegressionEqn)
\end{equation}
These are close to the values obtained using the rough method in Sect.\ \@ref(RegressionEquationsReview) (where $b_0 = 13.5$ and $b_1 = -0.1$ approximately).


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The *sign* of the slope $b_1$ and the *sign* of correlation coefficient $r$ are always the same.
For example, if the slope is negative, the correlation coefficient will be negative.

The regression equation for the dog-breed data in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:RedDeerRegressionEqn) can be used to make *predictions* of the mean value of\ $y$ for a given value of\ $x$.
For example, the equation can be used to predict the *average* lifespan of a breed with a breed-weight of $50$\kgs.
Since\ $x$ represents the breed-weight, use $x = 50$ in the regression equation:
\begin{align*}
         \hat{y} 
         &= `r DB.b0` - (`r abs(DB.b1)`\times 50)\\
         &= `r DB.b0` - `r abs(DB.b1 * 50)` = `r DB.b0 + DB.b1*10`.
\end{align*}
Dog breeds with an average weight of $50$\kgs are predicted to have a *mean* lifespan of $`r  DB.b0 + DB.b1 * 50`$\ys.
Some individual breeds with a breed-weight of\ $50$\kgs will have shorter or longer lifespans, and some individual dogs with a weight of\ $50$\kgs will have shorter or longer lifespans.
The model predicts that the *mean* lifespan for breeds weighing\ $50$\kgs will be about $`r DB.b0 + DB.b1 * 50`$\ys.


:::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The value of\ $\hat{y}$ is computed using the estimates\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$, which are computed from sample data. 
Hence, the value of\ $\hat{y}$ is also depends on which one of the countless possible samples is used.
This means that\ $\hat{y}$ also has a standard error.
:::


Suppose we were interested in dog breeds with a breed-weight of $100$\kgs; the mean predicted lifespan is
$$
  \hat{y} = 13.385 - (100 \times -0.093) = 22.685,
$$
or about\ $4.0854$\ys.
This prediction *may* be a useful prediction, but it also *may* be rubbish.
In the data, the heaviest breed is about\ $80$\kgs, so the regression line may not even apply for breeds with a breed-weight exceeding\ $80$\kgs.
For example, the relationship may be non-linear after $80$\kgs.
The prediction *may* be sensible, but it *may not* be either.
We don't know whether the prediction is sensible or not, because we have no data for breed-weights over\ $80$\kgs to inform us.

Making predictions outside the range of the available data is called *extrapolation*, and *extrapolation* beyond the data may lead to nonsense predictions.
As an extreme example, a breed-age of\ $150$ would be predicted to have a mean lifespan of $-0.565$\ys, which is clearly nonsense.

## Regression: understanding relationships {#RegressionForUnderstanding}
\index{Regression!equation!for understanding}

The regression equation can be used to *understand* the relationship between the two variables.
Consider again the dog-breed regression equation:
\begin{equation}
   \hat{y}
   = 
   `r DB.b0` 
   - 
    `r abs(DB.b1)` x.
   (\#eq:DogsLifeEquation)
\end{equation}
What does this equation reveal about the relationship between\ $x$ and\ $y$?


### The meaning of $b_0$

$b_0$ is the *predicted* value of\ $y$ when $x = 0$ (Sect.\ \@ref(Regression-Software)).
Using $x = 0$ in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:DogsLifeEquation) predicts a mean molar weight of
$$
  \hat{y} = 13.385 - (0.093\times 0) = 13.385
$$
for breeds with a weight of zero.
Using $x = 0$ is *extrapolating*\index{Extrapolation} (the smallest breed-weight in the sample is $4.08$\kgs), but using a breed weight of zero is nonsense anyway.


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The value of the intercept\ $b_0$ is sometimes (but not always) meaningless.
The value of the slope\ $b_1$ is usually of greater interest, as it explains the *relationship* between the two variables.
:::


### The meaning of $b_1$ {#SlopeMeaning}

The slope\ $b_1$ tells us how much the value of $y$ changes (on average) when the value of\ $x$ *increases* by one (Sect.\ \@ref(Regression-Software)).
For the dog-breed data, $b_1$ is the average change in mean lifetime for each\ $1$\kgs increase in breed-weight.

Specifically, each extra kilogram is associated with an average change of $`r DB.b1`$\ys in lifespan (see Eq.\ \@ref(eq:DogsLifeEquation)); that is, a *decrease* in lifespan by a mean of $`r abs(DB.b1)`$\ys.
The lifespan of some breeds will be shorter and some longer. and the lifespan of some individual dogs will be shorter and some longer; the value is a *mean* change in lifespan.

To demonstrate, consider the case where $x = 10$, and\ $y$ is predicted to be $\hat{y}= `r DB.b0 + 10 * DB.b1`$\ys.
For breeds one kilogram heavier than this (i.e., $x = 11$), the value of\ $y$ will increase by $b_1 = `r DB.b1`$\ys (or, equivalently, *decrease* by $0.093$\ys).
That is, we would predict $\hat{y}= `r DB.b0 + 10 * DB.b1`  - `r abs(DB.b1)` = `r DB.b0 + 11 * DB.b1`$\gs.
This is the same prediction made by using $x = 11$ in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:DogsLifeEquation).


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
If the value of\ $b_1$ is *positive*, then the predicted values of\ $y$ *increase* as the values of\ $x$ *increase*.
If the value of\ $b_1$ is *negative*, then the predicted values of\ $y$ *decrease* as the values of\ $x$ *increase*.
:::


This interpretation of $b_1$ explains the relationship: the lifespan is, on average, about $0.093$\ys shorter for each extra kilogram of breed-weight.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
In general, we say that a change in the value of\ $x$ is *associated* with a change in the value of\ $y$.
Unless the study is experimental (Sect.\ \@ref(ExperimentalStudies)), we cannot say that the change in the value of\ $x$ *causes* the change in the value of\ $y$. 
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
If the value of the slope is zero, there is *no linear relationship* between\ $x$ and\ $y$.
The slope means that a change in the value of\ $x$ is associated with a change of zero in the value of\ $y$.
In this case, the correlation coefficient is also zero.

## Regression: confidence intervals for regression parameters {#RegressionCI}

### Introduction {#RegressionTests-Intro}
\index{Confidence intervals!regression parameters}

A regression equation exists in the *population*, and is estimated using the sample information.
The regression line is estimated using the observed *sample* data.
That is, the regression line is estimated from one of the countless possible samples, and is an estimate of the regression line in the population.

In the *population*, the intercept is denoted by\ $\beta_0$ and the slope by\ $\beta_1$.
The regression line is
$$
  \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_x.
$$
The values of the parameters\ $\beta_0$ and\ $\beta_1$ are unknown, and are estimated by the statistics\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ respectively.


:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}


::: {style="display: flex;"}
The symbol\ $\beta$ is the Greek letter 'beta', pronounced 'beater' (as in 'egg beater').
So\ $\beta_0$ is pronounced as 'beater-zero', and\ $\beta_1$ as 'beater-one'.

Every sample is likely to produce a slightly different value for both\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ (*sampling variation*),\index{Sampling variation} so both\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ have a standard error and a sampling distribution.
The formulas for computing the values of\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ (and their standard errors) are intimidating, so we will use software to perform the calculations.


### Describing the sampling distribution {#SamplingDistributionSlopeCI}
\index{Sampling distribution!regression parameters}

The sample estimates\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ can vary across all possible samples, and so have *sampling distributions*.\index{Sampling distribution}
Under certain conditions (Sect.\ \@ref(ValidityCorrelationRegression)), the sampling distributions for both\ $b_0$ and\ $b_1$ are normal distributions.

Usually the slope is of greater interest than the intercept, because the slope explains the *relationship* between the two variables (Sect.\ \@ref(RegressionForUnderstanding)).
For this reason, the sampling distribution for the slope only is given below, but the sampling distribution for the intercept is analogous.


:::{.definition #Beta1SamplingDistn name="Sampling distribution of a sample slope"}
The sampling distribution of the sample regression slope is (when certain conditions are met; Sect.\ \@ref(ValidityCorrelationRegression)) described by

* an approximate normal distribution;
* with a mean of\ $\beta_1$; and 
* a standard deviation, called the *standard error of the slope* and denoted $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$.

A formula exists for finding $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$, but is tedious to use, and we will not give it.
:::


This sampling distribution describes all possible values of the sample slope from all possible samples, through *sampling variation*.
For the dog-breed data then, the values of the sample slope across all possible samples is described (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeSlopeSampDistCI)) as:

* an approximate normal distribution;
* with a sampling mean whose value is\ $\beta_1$; and 
* a standard deviation of $\text{s.e.}(b_1) = 0.0109$ (from software;\index{Software output!regression} Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeRegression)).

As seen earlier, when the sampling distribution is an approximate normal distribution, CIs have the form
$$
  \text{statistic} \pm ( \text{multiplier} \times \text{standard error}),
$$
where the multiplier is\ $2$ for an *approximate* $95$%\ CI (from the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule).
In this context, a CI for the slope is
$$
  b_1 \pm \big( \text{multiplier} \times \text{s.e.}(b _1)\big).
$$
Thus, an approximate $95$%\ CI is 
$$
  -0.0931 \pm (2\times 0.0109)\qquad\text{or}\qquad -0.0931 \pm 0.0218,
$$
which is from\ $-0.115$ to\ $-0.071$\ys/\kgs (after rounding).

Software can be used to produce *exact* CIs too (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeRegressionCI)); the exact $95$% CI is from\ $-0.115$ to\ $-0.071$\gs/year.\index{Software output!regression}
The *approximate* and *exact* $95$%\ CIs are very similar.
We write:

> For each increase of one year in the weight of dog breeds, the mean lifespan *increases* by\ $-0.093$ years per kg (approx.\ $95$%\ CI: $-0.115$ to\ $-0.071$; $n = 73$).

Alternatively (and equivalently, but probably easier to understand):

> For each increase of one year in the weight of dog breeds, the mean lifespan *decreases* by\ $0.093$ years per kg (approx.\ $95$%\ CI: $0.071$ to\ $0.115$; $n = 73$).

::: {.example #CyclonesCI name="Cyclones"}
Using the software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:CyclonesRegressionjamoviSPSS)) for the cyclone data, $\text{s.e.}(b_1) = 0.404$, so the approximate $95$%\ CI for the regression slope $\beta_1$ is
$$
   -2.23 \pm (2 \times 0.404)\text{\qquad {or}\qquad} -2.23 \pm 0.808.
$$
The interval from\ $-3.04$ to\ $-1.42$ is likely to straddle the population slope.

## Regression: $t$-tests for regression parameters {#RegressionHT}
\index{Hypothesis testing!regression parameters}

For the dog-breed data, the RQ posed in Sect.\ \@ref(CorrelationTesting) is

> In dog breeds, is there a linear relationship between weight and lifespan?

Since the regression line describing this relationship is computed from one of countless possible samples, any relationship between\ $x$ and\ $y$ observed in the sample may be due to sampling variation. 
Possibly, no relationship exists in the population (i.e., $\beta_1 = 0$); the only reason why a relationship appears in the *sample* is due to sampling variation.
That is, a hypothesis test can be conducted for the slope.
(Similar hypothesis tests can be conducted for the intercept, but are usually of less interest.)

The null hypothesis for tests about the slope is the usual 'no relationship' hypothesis.
In this context, 'no relationship' means that the slope is zero (Sect.\ \@ref(SlopeMeaning)), so the null hypotheses (about the *population*) is $H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$.
A slope of *zero* is equivalent to *no relationship* between the variables.
(We would also find $\rho = 0$.)
The RQ implies these hypotheses about the slope:
$$
   \text{$H_0$: } \beta_1 = 0\quad\text{and}\quad\text{$H_1$: } \beta_1 \ne 0.
$$
The parameter is\ $\beta_1$, the population slope for the regression equation predicting lifespan from breed-weight.
The alternative hypothesis is two-tailed, based on the RQ.


```{r}
DB.fitinfo <- summary(DB.lm)$coefficients
DB.t <- DB.fitinfo[, "t value"]
DB.P <- DB.fitinfo[, "Pr(>|t|)"]
```


Assuming the null hypothesis is true (i.e., that $\beta_1 = 0$), the possible values of the sample slope\ $b_1$ can be described (Def.\ \@ref(def:Beta1SamplingDistn)).
The variation in the sample slope across all possible samples when $\beta_1 = 0$ is described (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogBreedSlopeSampDist)) using:

* an approximate normal distribution;
* with a sampling mean whose value is $\beta_1 = 0$ (from $H_0$); and 
* a standard deviation of $\text{s.e.}(b_1) = 0.0109$ (from software; Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeRegressionCI)).

The *observed* sample slope for the red-deer data is $b_1 = -0.181$.
Locating this value on Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogBreedSlopeSampDist) shows that it is *very* unlikely that any of the many possible samples would produce such a slope, just through sampling variation, if the population slope really was $\beta_1 = 0$.
The *test statistic* is found using the usual approach when the sampling distribution has an approximate normal distribution:
\begin{align*}\index{Test statistic!t@$t$-score}
   t 
   &= \frac{\text{observed value} - \text{mean of the distribution of the statistic}}{\text{standard dev. of the distribution of the statistic}}\\
   &= \frac{ b_1 - \beta_1}{\text{s.e.}(b_1)} 
    = \frac{-0.0931 - 0}{0.0109} = -8.54,
\end{align*}
where the values of\ $b_1$ and\ $\text{s.e.}(b_1)$ are taken from the software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeRegressionCI)).
This $t$-score is the same value reported by the software. 


To determine if the statistic is *consistent* with the null hypothesis, the $P$-value can be approximated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, approximated using tables, or taken from software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeRegressionCI)).
Here, the $P$-value will be very small; software shows the *two*-tailed $P$-value is $P < 0.0001$.


We write:

> The sample presents very strong evidence ($t = -8.54$; two-tailed $P < 0.0001$) that, in the population, the mean lifespan of dog breeds is related to the breed-weight (slope: $-0.0931$; $95$%\ CI from\ $-0.115$ to\ $-0.071$; $n = 73$).

Notice the three features of writing conclusions again:
an *answer to the RQ*; evidence to support the conclusion ($t = -8.54$; two-tailed $P < 0.0001$); and some *sample summary information* (slope: $-0.0931$; $95$%\ CI from\ $-0.115$ to\ $-0.071$; $n = 73$).


::: {.example #ONIRegression name="Hypothesis testing"}

$$
From the output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:CyclonesRegressionjamoviSPSS)), $t = -5.52$ and the $P$-value is small: $P < 0.001$.
We write:

> The sample presents very strong evidence ($t = -5.52$; two-tailed $P < 0.001$) that, in the population, the number of cyclones is related to the ONI (slope: $-2.23$; $95$%\ CI from\ $-3.04$ to\ $-1.42$; $n = 37$).

## Statistical validity conditions {#ValidityCorrelationRegression}
\index{Statistical validity (for inference)!correlation coefficient}

As usual, these results hold under certain conditions.
The conditions for which the test is statistically valid are:

1. The relationship is approximately linear (necessary for the (Pearson) correlation coefficient and regression line to be appropriate).
1. The variation in the response variable is approximately constant for all values of the explanatory variable.
1. The sample size is at least\ $25$.

The sample size of\ $25$ is a rough figure; some books give other values.
The units of analysis are also assumed to be *independent* (e.g., from a simple random sample).

If the statistical validity conditions are not met, but the relationship is only increasing or only decreasing, alternative to the Pearson correlation coefficient include the Spearman\index{Correlation coefficient!Spearman} or Kendall correlation coefficients\index{Correlation coefficient!Kendall} [@conover2003practical] or using resampling methods [@efron2021computer].
Depending on which statistical validity conditions are not met, other regression-like options may be available.
For example, generalized linear models [@mypapers:dunnsmyth:glms] may be appropriate for some non-linear relationships.


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityDeer name="Statistical validity"}
For the dog-breed data, the scatterplot (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:DogsLifeScatter2)) shows that the relationship is approximately linear, so using a (Pearson) correlation coefficient and a regression line is appropriate.
For the hypothesis test, the variation in lifespans doesn't seem to be obviously getting consistently larger or smaller for heavier breeds (though two breeds with a lifespan near\ $6$\kgs with a breed-weight near\ $20$ seems unusual), and the sample size is also greater than\ $25$.
The CIs and tests are statistically valid.
:::


::: {.example #ONIValidity name="Cyclones"}
The scatterplot for the cyclone data (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ONIcyclones)) shows the relationship is approximately linear, that the variation in the number of cyclones seems reasonably constant for different values of the ONI, and the sample size is larger than\ $25$ ($n = 37$).
The CI (Example\ \@ref(exm:CyclonesCI)) and the test (Example\ \@ref(exm:ONIRegression)) are statistically valid.

## Example: removal efficiency {#Removal-Efficiency}

[*Dataset*: `Removal`]
In wastewater treatment facilities, air from biofiltration is passed through a membrane and dissolved in water, and is transformed into harmless by-products.
The removal efficiency\ $y$ (in\ %) may depend on the inlet temperature (in\ $^\circ$C; $x$).
@chitwood2001treatment asked:

> In treating biofiltration wastewater, is the removal efficiency linearly associated with the inlet temperature?

The scatterplot of the $n = 32$ observations was shown (and described) in Sect.\ \@ref(ScatterplotsRemoval-Efficiency), and repeated here (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:CorrelationRemovalEfficiency), left panel); the relationship is approximately linear.

The output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:CorrelationRemovalEfficiency), right panel) shows that the sample correlation coefficient is $r = 0.891$, and so $R^2 = (0.891)^2 = 79.4$%.\index{R@$R^2$}
This means that the unexplained variation in removal efficiency reduces by about\ $79.4$% by knowing the inlet temperature.


```{r CorrelationRemovalEfficiency, fig.cap="The relationship between removal efficiency and inlet temperature. Left: scatterplot. Right: software output.", fig.align="center", fig.width=5, fig.height=3.25, out.width=c("52%", "5%", "38%"), fig.show="hold"}
data(Removal)

plot(Removal ~ Temp, 
     data = Removal,
     main = "Removal efficiency",
     xlab = "Temperature (degrees C)",
     ylab = "Removal efficiency (%)",
     pch = 19,
     ylim = c(97.5, 99.0),
     xlim = c(5, 18),
     las = 1
     )

knitr::include_graphics("jamovi/Removal/RemovalCorrelation.png")
```


As always, the RQ is about the parameter, the correlation between the removal efficiency and inlet temperature in the population $\rho$.
To test if a linear relationship exists in the population, write:
$$
   \text{$H_0$: } \rho = 0\quad\text{and}\quad \text{$H_1$: } \rho \ne 0,
$$
where $\rho$ is the population correlation coefficient.
The alternative hypothesis is two-tailed (as implied by the RQ).
The software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:CorrelationRemovalEfficiency), right panel) shows that $P < 0.001$.
We conclude:

> The sample presents very strong evidence (two-tailed $P < 0.001$) that removal efficiency depends on the inlet temperature ($r = 0.891$; $n = 32$) in the population.

The relationship is approximately linear, there is no obvious non-constant variation in the removal efficiency, and the sample size is larger than\ $25$, so the hypothesis test result is statistically valid.

Since the scatterplot of the data (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:CorrelationRemovalEfficiency)) shows the relationship is approximately linear, a regression line is appropriate.
From the software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencyjamoviSPSSRegression)), $b_0 = 97.5$ and $b_1 = 0.0757$; hence
$$
  \hat{y} = 97.5 + 0.0757x
$$
for\ $x$ and\ $y$ defined above.
The slope quantifies the relationship, so we can test
$$
   \text{$H_0$: } \beta_1 = 0 \qquad\text{and}\qquad \text{$H_1$: } \beta_1 \ne 0.
$$
From the output, $t = 10.7$ which is huge; the $P$-value is small as expected: $P < 0.001$. 
The output does not include the CI for the slope, but since $\text{s.e.}(b_1) = 0.00705$, the *approximate* $95$%\ CI is
$$
  0.0757 \pm (2 \times 0.00705), \quad\text{ or }\quad 0.0757 \pm 0.0141.
$$
We write:

> Very strong evidence exists ($t = 10.7$; $P < 0.001$) that inlet temperature is linearly related to removal efficiency (slope:\ $0.0757$; approximate $95$%\ CI: $0.0616$ to\ $0.0898$).


```{r RemovalEfficiencyjamoviSPSSRegression, fig.cap="Regression output for the removal-efficiency data.", fig.align="center", out.width=c("55%", "75%"), fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("jamovi/Removal/RemovalRegression.png")
#knitr::include_graphics("SPSS/Removal/RemovalRegression-crop.png")
```

The CI and test are statistically valid: the relationship is approximately linear, the variation in $y$ is approximately constant for all values of $x$, and $n = 32$.

## Chapter summary {#Chap34-Summary}


To test a hypothesis about a correlation between two variables,\ $\rho$:

* Write the null hypothesis\ ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis\ ($H_1$).
* Initially *assume* the value of $\rho$ in the null hypothesis to be true (usually zero).
* Software output provides the $P$-value for the test, but no test statistic or CI.
* Make a decision, and write a conclusion.
* Check the statistical validity conditions.


`r if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  'The following short video may help explain some of these concepts:'
}`

*Regression* mathematically describes the relationship between two *quantitative* variables: the response variable\ $y$, and the explanatory variable\ $x$.
The linear relationship between\ $x$ and\ $y$ (the *regression equation*), in the sample, is
$$
   \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x,
$$
where\ $b_0$ is a number (the *intercept*), $b_1$ is a number (the *slope*), and the 'hat' above the\ $y$ indicates that the equation gives a *predicted mean* value of\ $y$ for the given $x$-value.
Software provides the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$.

The *intercept* is the predicted mean value of\ $y$ when the value of\ $x$ is zero.
The *slope* is how much the predicted mean value of\ $y$ changes, on average, when the value of\ $x$ *increases* by\ $1$.

The regression equation can be used to make *predictions* or to *understand* the relationship between the two variables.
Predictions made with values of\ $x$ outside the values of\ $x$ used to create the regression equation (called *extrapolation*)\index{Extrapolation} may not be reliable.

The regression equation in the population is
$$
  \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x.
$$
To compute a confidence interval (CI) for the slope of a regression equation, software provides the standard error of\ $b_1$, and the CI is
$$
   {b_1} \pm \left( \text{multiplier}\times\text{s.e.}(b_1) \right).
$$
The *margin of error* is (multiplier${}\times{}$standard error), where the multiplier is\ $2$ for an approximate $95$%\ CI (using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule).

To test a hypothesis about a population correlation coefficient $\rho$:

* Write the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis\ ($H_1$).
* Initially *assume* the value of\ $\beta_1$ in the null hypothesis to be true.
* Then, describe the *sampling distribution*, which describes what to *expect*  from the sample correlation coefficient on this assumption: under certain statistical validity conditions, the sample correlation coefficients vary with:
   *  an approximate normal distribution,
   *  with sampling mean whose value is the value of $\beta_1 = 0$ (from\ $H_0$), and
   *  having a standard deviation of $\displaystyle \text{s.e.}(b_1)$.
* Compute the value of the *test statistic*:
$$
   t = \frac{b_1 - \beta_1}{\text{s.e.}(b_1)},
$$
where\ $b_1$ is sample slope.
* The $t$-value is like a $z$-score, and so an approximate *$P$-value* can be estimated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, or found using software.
* Make a decision, and write a conclusion.
* Check the statistical validity conditions.

## Quick review questions {#Chap39-QuickReview}


```{r, results='hide'}
data(AISsub)
AIS.out <- lm(Wt ~ Ht, 
              data = subset(AISsub, Sport == "Rowing") )
summary(AIS.out)
```


::: {.webex-check .webex-box}
@data:Telford1991:sexsportsize examined the relationship between the height and weight of $n = 37$ rowers at the *Australian Institute of Sport* (AIS; Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ScatterAISRowers)).
The regression equation is $\hat{y} = -138 + 1.2 x$, and the two-tailed $P$-value for a test of the correlation is less than $0.0001$.


```{r ScatterAISRowers, results ='hide', fig.cap="Scatterplot of weight against height for rowers at the AIS.", fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5, fig.align="center"}
plot( Wt ~ Ht,
      data = subset(AISsub, Sport == "Rowing"),
      las = 1,
      xlim = c(150, 200),
      ylim = c(50, 100),
      main = "Weight vs Height: AIS rowers",
      xlab = "Height (in cm)",
      ylab = "Weight (in kg)",
      pch = 19)
```

Are the following statements *true* or *false*?

1. The $x$-variable is the height of the rower. \tightlist
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=TRUE) }`
1. Since the $P$-value is small, the correlation is quite strong.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=FALSE) }`
1. The relationship is a *positive* relationship.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=TRUE) }`
1. The value of $R^2$ is $87.3$%.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=FALSE) }`


1. Based on the scatterplot, 'weight of the rower' is considered the $y$-variable.  \tightlist
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=TRUE) }`
1. Using the 'rise-over-run' idea, a rough estimate of the value of the slope is $1.2$.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=TRUE) }`
1. The measurements units for the slope are kg.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=FALSE) }`
1. The measurements units for the intercept are kg.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=TRUE) }`
1. In the regression, $x$ represents the height of the rower.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=TRUE) }`
1. The standard error of the slope is $0.112$, so the value of the *test statistic* to test if the population slope is zero is $t = 10.7$.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=TRUE) }`
1. The $P$-value for this test will be *very small*.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( answer = TRUE)}`
1. Predicting the mean weight of a $220$\cms-tall rower would be *extrapolation*.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf(answer=TRUE) }`

Select the correct answer:

13. What does the 'hat' above the $y$ mean?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
  "That the weights are not measured accurately.",
  "That the weights are population values.",
  "That the regression model gives poor estimates.",
  "That the regression model gives good estimates.",

::: {.exercise #GraphsTypingCor}
[*Dataset*: `Typing`]
The `Typing` dataset contains four variables: typing speed (`mTS`), typing accuracy (`mAcc`), age (`Age`), and sex (`Sex`) for $1\,301$\ students [@pinet2022typing].
Is there evidence of a linear relationship between a person's mean typing speed and mean accuracy?
Explain.
