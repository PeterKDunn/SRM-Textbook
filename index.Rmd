<!-- TO RENDER -->
<!-- RUN IN R: -->

<!-- # render_book("index.Rmd", clean = FALSE) -->
<!--    where the  clean = TRUE  keeps the md files (for converting to epub?) -->

<!-- # render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book") -->
<!-- # render_book("index.Rmd"); render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book") -->

<!-- Only way I can get conversion to  epub  format to work: -->
<!-- pandoc -mathjax -s -highlight-style tango index.utf8.md -f -log=OUTPUT.log markdown -t epub -o OUTPUT.epub -->
<!-- BUT NEED DOUBLE HYPHENS AT mathjax! and  highlight!! -->

<!--  TO PUBLISH ON BOOKDOWN:  -->
<!-- library(rsconnect) -->

<!-- publish_book(name="Book"); publish_book() -->


<!-- # It seems that figures default to:  -->
<!-- #     fig.width=7 (inches) and fig.height = 5 (inches) -->

This book is an introduction to quantitative research in the scientific and health disciplines.
The whole research process is introduced,
from asking a research question to analysis and reporting of the data.
The focus, however, is on the analysis of data.




## Supporting documents {-}

To support this textbook, the following are also available:

* A [Tutorial Book](https://bookdown.org/pkaldunn/SRM-tutorials/); and
* A [Software Support Book](https://bookdown.org/pkaldunn/SRM-software/) with brief instruction for using jamovi and SPSS to perform *some* of the analyses in this book.

These books are both freely available online.




## The data sets used in this book {-}

Almost every data set used in this book is a real data set.
Many are available electronically so that 
you can download them and work with them in statistical software.
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'These are provided in the online version of this book (Appendix \\@ref(AppendixDataSets)).'
} else {
   'These are listed in Appendix \\@ref(AppendixDataSets).'
}`
Some data sets are taken from
@data:smyth:ozdasl.




## Statistical software {-}

Most of this book can be read without relying on any specific statistical software.
However,
some parts explicitly mention and refer to [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) 
[@Software:jamovi]
and/or
[SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics)
[@Software:SPSS].
jamovi is *free* and is like (but not exactly the same as) SPSS.
From the [jamovi homepage (sic)](https://www.jamovi.org/):

> jamovi is a new '3rd generation' statistical spreadsheet. 
> designed from the ground up to be easy to use, 
> jamovi is a compelling alternative 
> to costly statistical products such as SPSS and SAS.

## How this book was made {-}

This book was made using
**R**
[@Software:Rsoftware],
and the **bookdown** package
[@Software:Rbookdown],
which is based on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax,
using **knitr**
[@package:knitr].

Numerous other **R** packages were used too:

* The diagrams were made in base **R**,
  or using the **diagram** package [@Rpackage:diagram].
* The animations in the html version were made using the **animation** package [@package:animation], 
  and the stills for the PDF version captured by the **webshot** package [@package:webshot].
* The **gifski** package was used to create animations in the online version [@package:gifski].
* The **kableExtra** package was used for nicer tables [@package:kableExtra].
* The maps of Australia were generated using the **oz** package [@package:oz] and plotted using the **ggplot2** package [@package:ggplot2].
* The display of some data tables in the online version use the **DT** package [@package:DT].
* Some plots use the **plotrix** package [@package:plotrix].
* The NHANES data is provided by the **NHANES** package [@data:NHANES:Rpackage].
* Some data are from the **GLMsData** package [@computing:GLMsData:Rpackage].
* The **scales** package is used to rescale data [@package:scales].
* The carousels in the online version (for example, Sect. \@ref(UnderstandingScatterplots)) are made using the **slickR** package [@package:slickR].
* The **dygraphs** package [@package:dygraphs] is used to make interactive graphs (for example, Sect. \@ref(TimePlots)) for the online version.
* The **plotly** package [@package:plotly] is used to make some interactive graphs (for example, in Sect. \@ref(Histograms)) for the online version.
* The **dplyr** package is used in some data manipulations [@package:dplyr].
* The **viridis** package is used for some colour specifications [@package:viridis] to make colours easier for those with colour-blindess to distinguish colours, and for better greyscale printing.
* The **webexercises** package was used to create the interactive web exercises [@package:webex].
* The **plotfunctions** package was used to add images to existing plots [@package:plotfunctions]

All of this software is *free* and open source.

Other resources used include:

* The quizzes are embedded using [H5P](https://h5p.org) iframes.
* Icons are from [**iconmonstr**](https://iconmonstr.com/) 
  and are freely available.
* The images of the cards used in
  Sect. \@ref(NeedForDecisionMaking) 
  are from
  https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/,
  and are in the public domain.
* The text folding (in the html version)
  was implemented by adapting advice
  from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53810294/folding-general-text-in-r-bookdown).
* The images of dice used in, for example, Sect. \@ref(ProbClassical), are from 
  https://www.clipartkey.com/, and are free.
* The cover for the book was made using a free image using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).
* The images used in the online book are free (and used according to their guidelines), 
  as listed in Appendix \@ref(Image-Credits).
