This book introduces quantitative research in the scientific and health disciplines, with an emphasis on introductory statistics.
Unlike many introductory statistics textbooks, this textbook gives context to the statistics by first covering the basics of the research design process; it connects the research question with the means to answer that question.
I believe this is crucial to understanding the need and purpose of using statistics.

The book is designed for teaching at first-year undergraduate level, with examples mostly drawn from science, health and engineering.
Many real journal articles are used throughout the text as examples that demonstrate the use of the techniques.
Almost every dataset used in this book is a real dataset and available in the **R** package [**SRMData**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SRMData); also see App.\ \@ref(AppendixDataSets).

The main focus of the books is the analysis of data, with an emphasis on understanding the underlying concepts rather than a focus on using mathematics.
Software output is often used to help when calculations become onerous.
The output is from jamovi [@Software:jamovi], but is sufficiently generic that no knowledge of jamovi is necessary to use this book, and this book can be read without relying on any specific statistical software.
(jamovi, however, is **free** to download and use.)

The following call-outs are used in this book:


::: {.objectivesBox .objectives data-latex="{iconmonstr-target-4-240.png}"}
These chunks introduce the objectives for the chapters of the book.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
These chunks highlight common mistakes or warnings, about a particular concept or about using a formula.
:::


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
These chunks offer helpful information.
:::


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
These chunks refer to information about using software (jamovi) or a calculator.
:::


::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}
These chunks indicate how certain symbols and terms are pronounced.

`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) '<!--'`
::: {.EOCanswerBox .EOCanswer data-latex="{iconmonstr-check-mark-14-240.png}"}
These end-of-chapter chunks provide answers to the end-of-chapter *Quick review questions*.

This book was made using **R** [@Software:Rsoftware] with the **bookdown** package [@Software:Rbookdown], using `r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '**Markdown**'
} else {
   '[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)'
}` 
syntax and **knitr** [@package:knitr] and numerous other **R** packages.
All of this software is *free* and open source.
Other resources used include:

`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {'* Some online activities are created using **LearningApps.org**, which is free to use.'}`
* various icons from 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '**iconmonstr**'
} else {
   '[**iconmonstr**](https://iconmonstr.com/)'
}`
  (freely available).
* the images of the cards are in the public domain (e.g., in Sect.\ \@ref(NeedForDecisionMaking)), from https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/.

Earlier drafts of this textbook have been used to teach thousands of students, and the book has been used by many fantastic teaching assistants.
I thank all of them for their feedback.
Special thanks to Dr Amanda Shaker (La Trobe University), who reported numerous issues in earlier editions (and often provided corrections).
