This book introduces quantitative research in the scientific and health disciplines, with an emphasis on introductory statistics.
Unlike many introductory statistics textbooks, this textbook gives context to the statistics by first covering the basics of the research design process; it connects the research question with the means to answer that question.
I believe this is crucial to understanding the need and purpose of using statistics.
The research process is broken into six steps, which provide the framework for the content.

The book is designed for teaching at first-year undergraduate level, with examples mostly drawn from science, health and engineering.
Many real journal articles are used throughout the text in examples, to demonstrate the use of the techniques.
Almost every dataset used in this book is real and available in the **R**\ package
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '**SRMData**'
} else {
   '[**SRMData**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SRMData)'
}`(see App.\ \@ref(AppendixDataSets)).


The main focus of the book is the analysis of data, with an emphasis on understanding the underlying concepts rather than a focus on using mathematics.
Software output\index{Software output} is often used to help when calculations become onerous.
The output is from jamovi [@Software:jamovi],\index{Computers and software!jamovi} but is sufficiently generic that no knowledge of jamovi is necessary to use this book, and this book can be read without relying on any specific statistical software.
(jamovi, however, is *free* to download and use.)

This book was made using **R** [@Software:Rsoftware] with the **bookdown** package [@Software:Rbookdown], using `r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '**Markdown**'
} else {
   '[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)'
}` 
syntax and **knitr** [@package:knitr] and numerous other **R** packages.
All of this software is *free* and open source.
Other resources used include:

`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {'* Some online activities are created using **LearningApps.org**, which is free to use.'}`
* various icons from 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '**iconmonstr**'
} else {
   '[**iconmonstr**](https://iconmonstr.com/)'
}`
  (freely available).
* the images of the cards (e.g., in Sect.\ \@ref(NeedForDecisionMaking)), which are in the public domain and available from https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/.

Earlier drafts of this textbook have been used to teach thousands of students, and the book has been used by many fantastic teaching assistants.
I thank all of them for their feedback.
Special thanks to Dr Amanda Shaker (La\ Trobe University), who reported numerous issues in earlier editions (and often provided corrections).
