# Preface {-}

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html')}
knitr::include_graphics('OtherImages/coversmall.png', dpi = NA)
```


This book introduces quantitative research in the scientific and health disciplines.
The whole research process is introduced, from asking a research question to analysis and reporting of the data.
The main focus, however, is the analysis of data and understanding the underlying concepts.


## Supporting this book {-}

To support this textbook, the following are also available (and freely available online):

* A [Tutorial Book](https://bookdown.org/pkaldunn/SRM-tutorials/); and
* A [Software Support Book](https://bookdown.org/pkaldunn/SRM-software/) with brief instruction for using jamovi and SPSS to perform *most* of the analyses in this book.

Almost every dataset used in this book is a real dataset and available in the **R** package [**SRMData**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SRMData); also see App. \@ref(AppendixDataSets).


## Statistical software {-}

Most of this book can be read without relying on any specific statistical software.
Output is shown from jamovi [@Software:jamovi], but is sufficiently generic that no knowledge of jamovi is necessary.

jamovi is **free** to download and use.
While jamovi looks a little like a spreadsheet, underneath it uses the **R** statistical package [@Software:Rsoftware].



<!-- ## How to use this book {-} -->
```{r, child = if (knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")) 'UseHTML-bs4.Rmd'}
```

## How this book was made {-}

This book was made using **R** [@Software:Rsoftware] with the **bookdown** package [@Software:Rbookdown], using `r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '**Markdown**'
} else {
   '[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)'
}` 
syntax and **knitr** [@package:knitr].
Numerous other **R** packages were used too.
All of this software is *free* and open source.
Other resources used include:

`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {'* Some online activities are created using **LearningApps.org**, which is free to use.'}`
* various icons from 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '**iconmonstr**'
} else {
   '[**iconmonstr**](https://iconmonstr.com/)'
}`
(freely available).
* the images of the cards (e.g., in Sect. \@ref(NeedForDecisionMaking)), from https://code.google.com/archive/p/vector-playing-cards/  (in the public domain).

Special thanks to **Dr Amanda Shaker** (La Trobe University), who has advised of numerous issues (with the corrections).

## Learning Outcomes {-}

::: {.objectivesBox .objectives data-latex="{iconmonstr-target-4-240.png}"}
In this book, you will learn to:

* Develop quantitative research questions and testable hypotheses.
* Design quantitative studies to answer simple quantitative research questions.
* Select and produce appropriate graphical, numerical and statistical analyses.
* Select, apply and interpret the results of the correct statistical technique to analyse data.
* Comprehend, apply and communicate in the language of research and statistics.
* Demonstrate professional integrity in planning, interpreting and reporting the results of quantitative studies.
