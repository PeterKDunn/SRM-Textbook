## Introduction {#Chap7-Intro}

To draw solid conclusions, a well-designed study is needed: a study with high [*internal validity*](#def:InternalValidity).
When studying the relationship between the response and explanatory variables, ideally other explanations for changes in the value of response variable can be ruled out, so any remaining changes we see can be attributed to changes in the value of the explanatory variable.
Many aspects of the design must be considered to achieve this goal, some of which are discussed in this chapter.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
One goal of study design is to maximise internal validity: to design a study to isolate the relationship of interest, by eliminating, as well as possible, all other possible explanations.
:::


::: {.example #InternalValidity name="Importance of internal validity"}
Researchers [@beaman2013profitability] describe an experiment where free fertilizer was provided to a sample of female farmers in Mali (at the recommended amount rate, or at half the recommended rate).

Since all the farmers knew they were in the study, the farmers changed their farm management: they employed more hired labour and used more herbicide.
Consequently, the yields for *all* farmers improved, so knowing whether the amount of fertilizer applied changed yield is difficult.
The study had poor *internal validity*.
:::


Specific design strategies for maximising [internally validity](#def:InternalValidity) include:

* Managing confounding (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding)).
* Managing the carry-over effect using washout periods (Sect. \@ref(CarryOverEffectExperimental)).
* Managing the Hawthorne effect by blinding individuals (Sect. \@ref(HawthorneEffectExperimental)).
* Managing the placebo effect using controls (Sect. \@ref(PlaceboEffectExperimental)).
* Managing the observer-effect by blinding the researchers (Sect. \@ref(ObserverEffectExperimental)).
* Recording potential extraneous variables (Sect. \@ref(RecordExtraneous)).

Not all of these will be relevant to every study.
This chapter discusses experimental studies; the next chapter considers design issues for observational studies.

## Managing confounding {#ExpManagingConfounding}

<!-- Confounding has the potential to compromise the [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity) of the study and hence the interpretation of the results, so managing the impact of confounding is important. -->
Suppose that the researchers for the *Himalaya 292* study created two groups:

* **Group A**:  Women recruited at a female-only gym.
* **Group B**:  Men recruited at a local nursing home.

The researchers then gave *Himalaya 292* to Group A, and the refined cereal to Group B.
If a difference in faecal weight was detected between the two groups, the difference may due to:

* The different *diets* (the explanatory variable) for each group;
* The different *sexes* in each groups (Group A was all women; Group B was all men);
* The different *age* in each group was different (Group A is likely to be younger on average; Group B is likely to be older on average);
* The different health and fitness levels in each group (Group A would generally be healthier than those in Group B).

That is, any difference detected between the two groups may not be because of the cereal (Table \@ref(tab:ConfoundingGroups)): the study has very poor internal validity, due to poor study design.

These other variables are *confounding variables* (Def.\ \@ref(def:ConfoundingVariable)).
For example, the age of the subject may be related to faecal weight (older people tend to eat less, and eat differently, than younger people), and the study design means that older people are more likely to consume the refined cereal.
This is an extreme case of *confounding*; usually, confounding is more subtle (and hence more difficult to detect) than in this example.

Potentially, many extraneous variables exist in the *Himalaya* study, but we will demonstrate by just considering age.
How can we make sure that the age of the participants does not cause confounding in the *Himalaya* study?
Confounding can be *managed* by:

* [**Restricting**](#ExpConfoundingRestricting) the study to a certain group, such as only people under 30 (Sect. \@ref(ExpConfoundingRestricting)).
* [**Blocking**](#ExpConfoundingBlocking):
  Analyse the data separately for different groups, such as for people under 30, and 30 and over (Sect. \@ref(ExpConfoundingBlocking)).
* [**Analysing**](#ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis) using special methods, after recording the age of each subject (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis)).
* [**Randomly allocating**](#ExpConfoundingRandomAllocating) people to the two groups:
  Older and younger people would be spread approximately evenly between the *Himalaya* and refined-cereal groups (Sect. \@ref(Random-sampling-allocation)).

Multiple approaches can be used, such as randomly allocating individuals to groups, *and* recording other variables that can be managed through analysis (Example \@ref(exm:GinkoGroups)).

The first two approaches (*restricting*; *blocking*) are useful if one or two variables are known, or thought likely, to cause confounding.
The third approach (*analysing*) requires recording all the variables suspected of being confounders.
The fourth approach (*randomly allocating*) is superior if possible, because it reduces the chance of confounding for variables not even suspected as being confounding variables.

Common to many of these methods is to ensure that any potential confounding variables are recorded (Sect. \@ref(RecordExtraneous)), to ensure no *lurking variables* exist that may compromise the results.




::: {.example #GinkoGroups name="Comparing groups"}
An experiment to study the effect of using ginko to enhance memory [@data:Solomon2002:Ginko] compared two groups: one using ginko ($n = 111$), and one using a fake, non-active supplement ($n = 108$).
The authors randomly allocated participants to each group, then compared the two groups to ensure that no obvious differences initially existed between the groups that might explain  differences in the response variable (Table \@ref(tab:GinkoDemographics)).

The table shows that the two groups are very similar in terms of age, education and gender distribution.
Hence, any difference between the groups can probably be attributed to the treatment.
:::

	
```{r GinkoDemographics}
Ginko <- array( dim = c(3, 3) )
colnames(Ginko) <- c("Characteristic", 
                     "Group A (Ginko)",

Ginko[1, ] <- c("Average age (in years)",

:::{.exampleExtra  data-latex=""}
Researchers explored the use of dominant and non-dominant hands for chest compression in student paramedics using an experimental study [@cross2019impact].
Students were randomly divided into two groups: DHOS (dominant hand on chest) and NDHOC (non-dominant hand on chest).
The two groups were then compared:

| Demographic                  | All participants ($n = 75$) | DHOC ($n = 37$) | NDHOC ($n = 38$) 
| ----------------------------:+:---------------------------:+:---------------:+:----------------:
| Average age (years)          | 23.4                        | 22.5            | 24.3
| Gender: percentage Female    | 51%                         | 53%             | 47%

The two groups appear to be very similar in terms of average age of participants, and the percentage of female participants.
If differences are observed in the study between the DHOC and NDHOC groups, it is probably due to the treatment.
The study should have reasonable internal validity.
:::


### Restrictions {#ExpConfoundingRestricting}

Sometimes the impact of confounding is managed by *restricting the study to some groups*, by keeping some variables constant.
These variables are called *control variables*.
If possible, a reason for this restriction should be given.


::: {.example #HimalayaRestricting name="Restricting"}
In the *Himalaya* study [@data:Bird2008:wholegrain], the study might be restricted to subjects aged under 30.
The control variable would be 'age'.
:::

   
### Blocking {#ExpConfoundingBlocking}

*Blocking* is sometimes useful for minimising the impacts of confounding.
Blocking refers to separating the units of analysis into a small number of groups of similar individuals, then studying those groups separately. 
The *Himalaya* study might be blocked on age (Fig. \@ref(fig:BlockingHimalaya)).


::: {.definition #Blocking name="Blocking"}
*Blocking* is when units of analysis are arranged in separate groups of similar units (called *blocks*) , then those groups are studied separately.
:::



(ref:BlockingHimalaya) Blocking in the *Himalaya* study, based on age

```{r  BlockingHimalaya, fig.cap="(ref:BlockingHimalaya)",  fig.align="center", fig.width=8, fig.height=6, out.width="90%"}
showStudyDesignBlocking(studyType = "TrueExp",   
                        addIndividuals = TRUE)
```



### Analysis {#ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis}

Potential confounding variables---like other extraneous variables---can be accommodated in the analysis (using analyses beyond this book), *provided those variables have been recorded*.
Because of this, *recording all the extraneous variables likely to be important for understanding the data* is important.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
*Record* all the extraneous variables likely to be important for understanding the data.
This may include information about the *individuals* in the study, and the *circumstances* of the individuals in the study.
:::


For this reason, most studies involving people record the participants' age and sex, as these two variables are common confounders.
Once a sample is obtained, recording this extra information usually requires little extra effort.


::: {.example #HimalayaAnalysis name="Analysis"}
In the *Himalaya 292* study, the sex, age, pre-study weight and pre-study BMI were also recorded for each individual, and used in the subsequent analysis.
:::


::: {.example #Manure name="Analysis"}
An experimental study [@schroder2015maize] compared nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in maize, for evenly-injected liquid manure and band-injected liquid manure.
As potential confounding variables, the researchers also recorded the average temperature and the precipitation (between May 1 and September 30) at each site.
:::


### Random allocation {#ExpConfoundingRandomAllocating}

One way to minimise confounding is to [randomly](#def:Random) allocate individuals in the study to the treatment groups.
The advantage of random allocation is that it should approximately evenly distribute potential confounding variables that have been identified (such as age) but also those variables that may *not* have even been considered as confounders, or are hard to measure or observe (such as genetic conditions).

In the *Himalaya* study, the units of analysis (the people) could be allocated to a group at random, and then the groups allocated a diet through a toss of a coin (Fig. \@ref(fig:RandomAllocationHimalaya)).


::: {.example #HimalayaRandomAllocation name="Random allocation"}
In the *Himalaya 292* study, the article reports that 'Subjects were allocated randomly to [...] dietary treatments...' (@data:Bird2008:wholegrain, p. 1033).

### Random allocation vs random sampling {#Random-sampling-allocation}

Random *sampling* and random *allocation* are different concepts (Fig. \@ref(fig:RandomAllocationSampling)), that serve different purposes, but are often confused:

* *Random sampling* impacts *external* validity, and concerns *how to find the sample* to study.
* *Random allocation* helps eliminate confounding issues, by evening-out possible confounders across treatment groups.
  *Random allocation* impacts *internal* validity, and concerns *how the members of the chosen sample get the treatments*.

## Carry-over effect and washout periods {#CarryOverEffectExperimental}

In the *Himalaya* study, suppose patients spent two weeks on the *Himalaya 292* diet, then the following two weeks on the refined cereal diet.
Potentially, the influence of the first diet could still be impacting the subjects' faecal weight for a little while after stopping the first diet.
This could compromise the [internally validity](#def:InternalValidity) of the study.
This is an example of the *carry-over effect*.
This may mean that the influence of one treatment carries over into the influence of the next treatment.


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-chart-21-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #CarryoverEffect name="Carryover effect"}
The carry-over effect occurs when the influence of past experience(s) of the individuals carry over to influence future experience(s) of the individuals.
:::

The impact of the carry-over effect may be minimized by using a *washout* or similar.
For example, after tasting a food sample, participants may rinse their mouth with water before tasting another food sample.
For the *Himalaya* study, the participants could spend four weeks between the two special diets on their usual (before-study) diet, called a *washout period*.


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-gil-goldman-4268507.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example #HimalayaCarryOver name="Carry-over effect"}
In the *Himalaya 292* study, the authors report that 'there was no washout period' (@data:Bird2008:wholegrain, p. 1033) since the response variable was only recorded after individuals spent four weeks on the diets.
Since faecal weight was not measured until the end of this four weeks, the effect of the diet change would be minimal.
:::


::: {.example #HimalayaWashout name="Carry-over effect"}
An engineering study [@miller2019behavioral] examined drivers' exposure to lane-keeping systems on their driving performance.
Subjects were exposed to a driving simulation that used a lane-keeping system, and then to a driving simulation without using a lane-keeping system.
The researchers found that there was a carry-over effect when drivers moved from a simulation with a lane-keeping system to one without a lane-keeping system.
:::




::: {.example #VRWashout name="Carry-over effect"}
In @jaskiewicz2020chest, student paramedics performed chest compression in real-life (RL), and also using virtual reality (VR).
A relaxation percentage of about 50% is ideal.

Whether the VR method was used first or not (Table \@ref(tab:CompressionTable), first columns), the percentage relaxation changed little when using the real-life method, and was far higher than the target of 50%.
When used by itself, VR was very close to the target percentage of 50%.
However, if the RL method was used *before* VR, the percentage relaxation was far higher than the target percentage.

That is, the *order* in which the two methods was used made a huge difference in the relaxation percentage recorded.

Sometimes, when relevant, researchers can *randomly allocate* the *order* in which the treatments (i.e., the diets) are used (a *cross-over study*).
That is, some participants start by spending four weeks on the *Himalaya 292* diet, then four weeks on the refined cereal diet; meanwhile, other participants start by spending four weeks on the refined cereal diet, then four weeks on the *Himalaya 292* diet.


::: {.example #HimalayaCarryOver2 name="Carry-over effect"}
In the *Himalaya 292* study, the authors report that "subjects were allocated randomly to [...] dietary treatments" (@data:Bird2008:wholegrain, p. 1033).
Subjects were randomly allocated to begin the study on the *Himalaya 292* diet, while others started on the refined cereal diet.
:::


::: {.example #ParamedOrder name="Washout periods"}
A study of paramedics [@data:MacDonald:Resuscitation] required paramedics to conduct eight different tasks (such as electrical defibrillation and intravenous cannulation).
The *order* in which each of the 16 paramedics performed the eight tasks was arranged so that not every paramedic started with Task 1, followed by Task 2, etc. to "control for possible effects of practice" (p. 255); that is, to mitigate the carry-over effect.
A washout period between tasks was also used.
:::


## Hawthorne effect and blinding individuals {#HawthorneEffectExperimental}

Suppose patients in the *Himalaya 292* study were being watched (or waited for) while defecating.
Could this lead to a misleading conclusion?

Individuals (not just people) often behave differently (either positively or negatively) if they know (or think) they are in a study, or are being watched, which could compromise the [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity) of the study.
This is called the *Hawthorne effect*.


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-binoculars-8-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #HawthorneEffect name="Hawthorne effect"}
The Hawthorne effect is the tendency of individuals to change their behaviour if they know (or think) they are being observed.
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-gil-goldman-4268507.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example #HawthorneFruitVege name="Hawthorne effect"}
People are more health-conscious if they know they will be followed-up regularly.
For example, a study aiming to increase fruit and vegetable intake in young adults [@clark2019educational] noted that the changes recorded "could be explained by the Hawthorne effect", since being in the study "can inherently cause participants to change behavior because they know they are being observed..." [@clark2019educational].
:::


The impact of the Hawthorne effect can be minimized by [blinding](#Blinding) the individuals in the experiment so that the individuals do not know:

* that they are in a study;
* the aims of the study; and/or 
* which treatment they are receiving in the study. 

If individuals do not know which treatment they receiving, they cannot behave differently according to the treatment they receive, but their behaviour may still change if they know they are in a study.
Blinding *people* to knowing they are involved in a study is often difficult, as ethics often requires individuals' informed consent.


::: {.example #HawthorneHimalaya name="Hawthorne effect"}
In the *Himalaya 292* study, the authors report:

> The study was explained fully to the subjects, both verbally and in writing, and each gave their written, informed consent before participating. 
> 
> --- @data:Bird2008:wholegrain, p. 1033

That is, the subjects knew they were in a study, and knew the aims of the study; these were ethics requirements. 
Hence, the Hawthorne effect may influence the results in this study.
However, the subjects did not know which diet they were on (@data:Bird2008:wholegrain, p. 1033).

::: {.example #HawthorneTeeth name="Hawthorne effect"}
In an experimental study [@lorenz2019effect] to compare the efficacy of a new type of toothpaste, participants were given two types of toothpaste to use (new; existing), and evaluations of plaque remaining on the teeth were taken.
*Both* groups recorded a reduced amount of plaque.

The reason was the Hawthorne effect: since all participants knew they were being assessed after brushing, they brushed differently than usual.
:::


## Placebo effect and using controls {#PlaceboEffectExperimental}

Suppose people *thought* they were on the wholegrain diet, but they weren't.
Perhaps surprisingly, individuals in a study may report effects of a treatment (either positive or negative), even if they have not received an active treatment.
This could compromise the [internally validity](#def:InternalValidity) of the study.
This is called the *placebo effect*, which generally only impacts people as individuals.


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-help-3-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #PlaceboEffect name="Placebo effect"}
The placebo effect is when individuals report perceived or actual effects without having received the treatment.
:::


Managing the placebo effect is difficult! 
However, the impact of the placebo effect can be minimized using a *control group*: units of analysis without the treatment applied, but *as similar as possible* in every other way to those units of analysis receiving the treatment.
This allows the effect of the treatment to be assessed, *over and above* the placebo effect.
In addition, recording objective data (rather than patient-reported outcomes) may reduce the placebo effect [@enck2013placebo]; see Example \@ref(exm:PlaceboPrice).


::: {.definition #Control name="Control"}
A *control* is a unit of analysis without the treatment applied, but as similar as possible in *every other way* to other units of analysis.
:::


Sometimes the control group receives a *placebo*: a non-effective treatment that appears to be the real treatment.
Those who receive the placebo should be selected through random allocation when possible.
Sometimes, using a placebo is unethical.

::: {.definition #Placebo name="Placebo"}
A *placebo* is a treatment with no intended effect or active ingredient, but appears to be the real treatment.

::: {.example #HimalayaPlacebo name="Placebo effect"}
In the *Himalaya 292* study, the authors report that the individuals "were not told the identity of the test cereal in the foods provided" (@data:Bird2008:wholegrain, p. 1033).
The subjects were [blinded](#Blinding) to the diet they were exposed to.
However, some may *think* they are on the refined cereal or *Himalaya* diet, and respond accordingly (perhaps unconsciously).
The use of the refined cereal was acting as a control.

Three active analgesics (pain relievers) were compared to four different-coloured placebo [@data:Huskisson1974:placebo] in 22 patients.

Note that 'pain relief' is subjective.

About 85% of participants in the first group reported a pain reduction, yet only 61% in the second group reported a pain reduction.

## Observer effect and blinding researchers {#ObserverEffectExperimental}

Suppose the *researchers* assessing the outcomes *knew the diet* allocated to each patient, and were hoping that the new diet performed better than the refined cereal diet.
Could this lead to a misleading conclusion?

Perhaps surprisingly, researchers' expectations or hopes for how the new diet will perform may unconsciously influence how the researchers interact with the individuals, and perhaps (unconsciously) influence the behaviour of the individuals in the study.
This is called *observer effect*.
(In experiments, it is sometimes called the *experimenter effect*.)
This could compromise the [internally validity](#def:InternalValidity) of the study.


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-idea-10-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #ObserverEffect name="Observer effect"}
The observer effect occurs when the researchers unconsciously change their behaviour to conform to expectations because they know what values of the explanatory variable apply to the individuals.
This may cause the *individuals* to change their behaviour or reporting also.
:::


The impact of the observer effect can be minimized by blinding the researchers so that they do not know which treatments the individuals are receiving.
The researchers *giving* the treatment and the researchers *evaluating* the treatment can both be blinded, by using a third party.  
For example, the researchers may give an assistant two drugs, labelled A and B.
The assistant administers the drug and evaluates the participants' response to the treatments.
Later, the assistant tells the researchers whether Drug A or Drug B performed better, but only the researchers know which drugs the labels A and B refer to (Fig. \@ref(fig:BlindingThirdParty)).

                addIndividuals = TRUE, 
                addThirdParty = TRUE)

The observer effect does not just apply to situations where *people* are used as participants.

   'Clever Hans'
} else {
   "['Clever Hans'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans)"

was a horse that seemed to perform simple mental arithmetic.
After much study, Carl Stumpf realised that the horse was responding to involuntary (and unconscious) cues from the trainer, by using an experiment where the people interacting with the horse were blinded.

The same effect has been observed in narcotic sniffer dogs [@bambauer2012defending], who may respond to their handlers' unconscious cues.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The *observer effect* is when the researcher *unconsciously* influences the individuals, and are not aware it is occurring.
*Intentionally* influencing the individuals is called [fraud](#Fraud).

## Describing blinding {#DescribingBlinding}

*Blinding* occurs when those involved in the study do not know information about the study.

The *individuals* in the study may be blinded to 

* being in a study;
* to the aims of the study in which they are participants; and/or 
* to which comparison groups or connection values apply to them.

The *researchers* and the *analysts* can be blinded to which comparison groups or connection values apply to the individuals. 

When as many participants as possible are blinded in as many ways as possible, the internal validity of the study is increased and bias reduced.
However, when people are the individuals, ethics requirements may mean that they need to know they are in a study (especially if the study is experimental), and the purpose of the study.

If *only* the participants are blinded to the comparison groups or connections that apply to them, the study is called *single blind*.
If *both* the researchers and participants are blinded to the comparison groups or connections that apply, the study is called *double blind*.
If the researchers, participants *and* the analyst are blinded to the comparison groups or connections that apply , the study is called *triple blind*.

Rather than using these terms, explicitly stating who or what is blinded---and in what ways---is recommended for clarity.

Blinding should be considered in all studies when possible (and it is *not* always possible).
*Blinding of participants does not just apply to people*; it also may apply to animals (Example \@ref(exm:CleverHans)).


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
Why might it be necessary to blind the *analyst* to the treatments being used?
:::


::: {.example #BlindingCowpea name="Double-blinding"}
In a cropping study comparing yields from modern and traditional cowpea crops in Tanzania [@bulte2014behavioral], the researchers wanted to use a double-blind study.
Hence, the two seed types ('traditional' and 'modern') were made similar in appearance.

The seed type would eventually become obvious as the crop grew, but "this does not invalidate [the] design because key inputs were already provided" by that stage (p. 817).
:::


::: {.example #BlindingParamedic  name="Blinding"}
In a study comparing chest compressions with dominant and non-dominant hands of student paramedics [@cross2019impact], the article states that the individuals "were blinded to the specific research question at any stage..." (@cross2019impact, p. 2).
Participants could not, however, be blinded to which group they were in (dominant hand on chest; non-dominant hand on chest).
In this case, participants were only *partially* blinded.

Later, the article reports that "Data were analysed by a biostatistician blinded to group allocation" (@cross2019impact, p. 3), meaning that the analyst was blinded to the treatments.
:::



## Recording extraneous variables {#RecordExtraneous}

One way to design a quality study is to record information about many extraneous variables.
Various reasons for doing this have been given:

* To compare the sample to the population, to determine if the sample is representative (external validity; Sect. \@ref(Representative-samples)).
* To explain some variation in the response variable, so that the relationship between the response and explanatory variable can be revealed. (Sect. \@ref(ExtraneousVariables)).
* To manage confounding:
  * To avoid lurking variables (Sect. \@ref(ExtraneousVariables)).
  * To determine if the groups being compared are similar (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding)).
  * To use the information in analysis (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis)).

The key message is to *record the values of all extraneous variables that may be important in the study*!


## Summary {#Chap7-Summary}

Designing effective *experimental* studies (Fig. \@ref(fig:DesignConsiderations)) requires researchers to *manage or minimise confounding* where possible, by:

* *restricting* the study to certain groups;
* *blocking* individuals into similar groups;
* through special *analysis* methods; and/or 
* through *random allocation* of the units of analysis.

Well-designed experimental studies also try to manage:

* the *carry-over effect* (e.g., by using a washout, or randomly allocating the order of treatments);
* the *Hawthorne effect* (e.g., by blinding participants to the treatment);
* the *placebo effect* (e.g., by blinding participants to the treatments and using *controls*); and
* the *observer effect* (e.g., by blinding the researchers to the treatments being applied).

This ensures that the results and conclusions from our studies are correctly interpreted.

Often, however, not all of these issues can always be managed (Table \@ref(tab:BiasesStudied)).
For instance, individuals often know they are involved in an experimental study, so the Hawthorne effect may be relevant.
In these cases, the possible impacts should be minimized as far as possible, and then the likely impact on the conclusions discussed.
The impact of these issues are often reported as *limitations* in a journal article (Chap. \@ref(Interpretation)), perhaps part of the Discussion section.

::: {.example #DesignExample name="Study design"}
In a study of student paramedics comparing chest compressions using dominant and non-dominant hands [@cross2019impact] (Example \@ref(exm:BlindingParamedic)):

> ...participants were allocated randomly to one of two groups: 'dominant hand on chest' or 'non-dominant hand on chest'. 
> Group allocation was determined by a computer-generated randomisation schedule...
>
> --- @cross2019impact, p. 3

The participants were blinded to the *purpose* of the study, but not to which group they were allocated.
The analyst was also blinded to the group allocations.
This study used a number of good design features.

## Quick review questions {#Chap7-QuickReview}

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}
A study [@doosti2016development] wanted to determine the relationship between the surface temperature of the apple, and the depth of bruising.
The researchers purposefully hit apples with three different *forces* (200, 700 and 1200&nbsp;mJ) to inflict bruises.
The researchers then recorded the *depth* of the bruising, and recorded the *surface temperature* at each bruise location.

The study was conducted separately for three different *regions* of the apple (lower; middle; upper), and each apple was only used once.

1. The *response variable* is\tightlist
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
	"The force used on the apples",
	answer = "The depth of the bruising",
	"The location of the bruising",
	"The surface temperature at the bruise site"))} else {"________________"}`
1. The *explanatory variable* is
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
	"The force used on the apples",
	"The depth of the bruising",
	"The location of the bruising",
	answer = "The surface temperature at the bruise site"))} else {"________________"}`
1. What is the *best* description for the variable 'The location of the bruising'?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
	"A confounding variable, since it may be related to the explanatory variable only",
	"A confounding variable, since it may be related to the response variable and explanatory variables",
	answer = "An extraneous variable, because it is likely to be related to the response variable only",
	"A lurking variable, since we don't know how it might be related to the response and explanatory variables"))}`
1. True or false: The researchers could minimise the effects of confounding by incorporating potential confounding variables in the analysis.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( TRUE)}`
1. True or false: The researchers could use random allocation of the treatments to the apples to minimise confounding.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( TRUE)}`
1. True or false: The *carry-over* effect is likely to be a big problem in this study.

The scientist provides people with a plastic cup of either bottled or tap water, and she asks them to give a rating of the taste on a scale of 1 (terrible) to 5 (fantastic).

What potential problems can you identify with the study design?

Consider this RQ (based on @teillet2010consumer)):

> Among university students, is the taste of tap water different than the taste of bottled water?

This RQ needs some clarification, but you decide to answer this question using an *experiment*.
How would you manage:

1. Random allocation?
1. Blinding?
1. Double blinding?
1. Finding a control?
1. Finding a random sample?

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignSunscreen}
In a study of time spent applying sunscreen [@data:Heerfordt2018:sunscreen] the Aim was to 'determine whether time spent on sunscreen application is related to the amount of sunscreen used' (@data:Heerfordt2018:sunscreen, p. 117).
The authors describe the study design as follows:

> The volunteers were asked to apply the provided sunscreen [...] the way they would normally do on a sunny day at the beach in Denmark [...]
> The volunteers wore swimwear during the whole session. 
> No other information was given. 
> Participants applied sunscreen behind a curtain and were not observed during application. 
> Measurements of time and sunscreen weight were made without the subjects' being aware of this.

1. What are the response and explanatory variables?
1. The researchers also recorded age, height, weight and body surface area of each participant. 
   Why would they have done this?
1. The researchers also compared the mean values of the response variable for males and females, 
   and the mean values of the explanatory variable for males and females. 
   Why would they have done this? 
1. What design features are being used in the second quote?

**Answers to in-chapter questions:**

- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:HimalayaPOCI}: 1. **P**: Australians. **O**: average faecal weight. **C**: between those eating food made using refined cereal, and those eating food made from *Himalaya 292*. There appears to be an intervention (*provided* food). 2. The information that *must* be gathered from each individual: the faecal weight; the type of grain consumed (refined or *Himalaya 292*). 3. True experiment.
- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:Control}: The controls are *not* just people who don't get the injections. 
Ideally, controls would be people who, like the treatment group, report to a GP and receive an injection... however, they just receive an injection that will do nothing.

- \textbf{\textit{Quick Revision} questions:}
**1.** The surface temperature at the bruise.
**2.** The depth of the bruising.
**3.** An extraneous variable, because it is likely to be related to the response variable only.
**4.** True.
**5.** True.
**6.** False.
**7.** False.
**8.** False.
**9.** False.
