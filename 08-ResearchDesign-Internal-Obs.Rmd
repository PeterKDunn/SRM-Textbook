```{block2, type="rmdobjectives"}
So far,
you have learnt to
ask a RQ, 
identify different ways of obtaining data, and design the study.

**In this chapter**, 
you will learn how to ensure that the 
conclusions we can make are logical and sound in *observational* studies. 
You will learn to:

* maximise the internal validity of observational studies.
* manage confounding in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the carry-over effect in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the Hawthorne effect in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the placebo effect in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the observer-expectancy effect in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage observer bias in observational studies.

## Introduction {#Chap8-Intro}

In experimental studies,
many aspects of the study design typically can be controlled by the researcher,
so experimental studies are often easier to design to maximise [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity).
In contrast,
*observational studies* have fewer design features that can be controlled by the researchers.

For example,
treatments are not imposed in observational studies,
so random allocation of treatments is impossible,
and hence *confounding* is always a potential threat
to [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity] in observational studies.

Nonetheless,
researchers should still consider aspects of research design
when designing observational studies,
and manage those aspects when possible to maximise the internal validity.
Specific design strategies that we consider for maximising [internally validity](#def:InternalValidity) are:

* [Managing confounding](#ObsManagingConfounding);
* [Managing the carry-over effect](#CarryOverEffectObservational);
* [Managing the Hawthorne effect](#HawthorneEffectObservational);
* [Managing the placebo effect](#PlaceboEffectObservational).
* [Managing observer expectancy](#ObserverEffectObservational); and
* [Managing observer bias](#ObserverBiasObservational); and

Not every design consideration will be relevant to every study.

```{lemma ObservationalStudiesSmoke, name="Observational studies"}
@doll1954mortality
wrote to a large number of British doctors,
and asked how much they smoked.
Then they observed smokers and non-smokers for many years,
and recorded who died of lung cancer.

Why is this is an *observational* study?
```



```{r echo=FALSE}
Observational <- "Because the value of the explanatory variable ('whether or not the doctor smoked') is not determined by the researcher. That would be unethical."

Observational <- foldLaTeXText
}
```

## Managing confounding {#ObsManagingConfounding}

In Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding)
different methods were listed for managing confounding
in experimental studies.
Some, but not all, of these are still possible in observational studies:

* [**Restricting**](#ObsConfoundingRestricting) the study to a certain group 
  (for example, only people under 30).
* [**Blocking**](#ObsConfoundingBlocking).
  Analyse the data separately for different groups 
  (for example, analyse the data separately for people under 30, and 30 and over).
* [**Analysing**](#ObsManagingConfoundingAnalysis)
  using special methods 
  (after measuring the age of each subject).
* [**Randomly allocating**](#ObsConfoundingRandomAllocating)
  people to groups:
  Not possible in observational studies.



### Restrictions {#ObsConfoundingRestricting}

As with experimental studies,
observational studies can be restricted to certain parts of the population.
For example,
in the smoking study of 
@doll1954mortality,
participants were restricted to males aged under 35 years
since, at the time of the study:

> ... lung cancer is
> relatively uncommon in women and
> rare in men under 35 [and]
> useful figures are unlikely to be
> obtained in these groups for some years to come.
>
> --- @doll1954mortality, p. 1452.

The reason for the restriction should be justified if possible
(as shown in the quote above).




###  Blocking {#ObsConfoundingBlocking}

Blocking can be used with observational studies;
for example,
those aged under 30 and those aged 30 or over
could be analysed separately.

This, of course, requires the age of the participants to be available to the researchers.





### Analysis {#ObsManagingConfoundingAnalysis}

The best advice for observational studies
is to **measure, observe, assess or record 
all the information that is likely to be important for understanding the data**.
While this strategy is also useful for experimental studies,
it is particularly important for observational studies,
as managing confounding through analysis 
(Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis))
is often one of the few practical means available.


```{block2, type="rmdimportant"}
*Measure, observe, assess or record* 
all the information that is likely to be important 
for understanding the data.
This may include information about

* the individuals in the study; and 
* the circumstances of the study.

```


```{example name="Analysis"}
In a different smoking study,
@data:DollHill1950:Smoking recorded  
the social class and place of residence
of each participant,
as potential confounding variables.
```


```{example ConfoundingKiwi, name="Confounding"}
An observational study of 2599 kiwifruit orchards 
[@data:froud2018:kiwifruit]
explored the relationship between the time since a bacterial canker
was first detected (in weeks) 
and the orchard productivity (in tray equivalents per hectare).

The researchers also recorded information such as 
'whether or not the farm was organic',
'elevation of the orchard' 
and
'whether or not general fungicides were used'.

They used these variables in their analysis to manage the 
potential effects of confounding.
Their analysis showed that 
'elevation of the orchard' 
and
'whether or not general fungicides were used'
were important confounding variables,
but 
'whether or not the farm was organic' was not.
```



### Random allocation {#ObsConfoundingRandomAllocating}

In observational studies,
the study conditions are not allocated by the researchers
(at random or otherwise),
so random allocation of treatments is not possible

For this reason,
confounding is often a major threat to [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity) in observational studies,
as individuals who are in one group may be different
to those who are in another group
(Table \@ref(tab:SedentaryDemographics)).
As a result,
researchers often summarise the groups 
being compared on various potential confounding variables.


```{example, ActiveSedentaryWomen, name="Comparing study groups"}
In an observational study comparing the 
iron levels of active and sedentary women aged 18 to 35
[@data:woolf:ironstatus],
the authors compared the 
active women ($n=28$) to the sedentary women ($n=28$) 
on a variety of characteristics.

However,
maybe the intrinsic physical differences between 
the women in the two groups 
might explain any differences found
between iron levels in two two groups.

To determine this,
the researchers examined many characteristics of the women;
some are shown in 
Table \@ref(tab:SedentaryDemographics).

They conclude that active women in their sample 
tended to be (in general) slightly younger, f\
slightly heavier and taller, and
slightly more likely to use hormonal contraceptives.
Hence,
any difference in iron levels between the two groups
may be because of the active/sedentary nature of the groups,
or because the active group was (in general) younger,
for example.
```


	
```{r echo=FALSE, SedentaryDemographics}
WomenIron <- array( dim=c(4, 3) )
colnames(WomenIron) <- c("Characteristic", "Active women", "Sedentary women")

WomenIron[1, ] <- c("Average age (in years)", "20", "24")
WomenIron[2, ] <- c("Average height (in cm)", "169", "166")
WomenIron[3, ] <- c("Average weight (in kg)", "68", "62")
WomenIron[4, ] <- c("Percentage using hormonal contraceptives", "13", "11")

  
if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  kable(WomenIron,
        format = "latex",
        longtable = FALSE,
        booktabs = TRUE,
        escape = FALSE, # For latex to work in \rightarrow
        linesep = c("", "", "", "", "", ""), # Otherwise addes a space after five lines... 
        caption = "The demographic information for those in the study of iron levels in women",
        align = "r")   %>%
   kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 10) %>%
  row_spec(0,bold=TRUE) # Columns headings in bold
}

if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
  kable(WomenIron,
        format = "html",
        align = "r",
        longtable = FALSE,
      caption = "The demographic information for those in the study of iron levels in women",
      booktabs = TRUE)
}
```









```{block2, type="exampleExtra"}
In the smoking study of
@doll1954mortality,
doctors who chose to smoke may be inclined to undertake other
risky behaviours,
whereas those doctors who choose *not* to smoke
may also be inclined to *not* undertake other risky behaviours.
It may be those *other* risky behaviours that lead to 
lung cancer, and not the smoking itself.

In a different smoking study,
@data:DollHill1950:Smoking
used a control group.
The control group was chosen to be very similar to those in the lung-cancer group,
in terms of age and sex.
(That is,
the numbers of females and males within each age group
was very similar for those with lung cancer, and those without lung cancer.)
```


```{block2, type="rmdimportant"}
Observational studies *can* (and often do) have control groups.
Indeed,
one specific type of observational study is called 
a [*case-control study*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case%E2%80%93control_study). 

However,
individuals are not *allocated* to the control group by the researchers
in observational studies.
```





```{block2, type="exampleExtra"}
A study [@data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter]
examined the difference between two types of 
helicopter transfer (physician-staffed; non-physician-staffed) of patients 
with a specific type of myocardial infarction (STEMI).
The purpose of the study was:

> ...to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of physician-staffed HEMS (Physician-HEMS) 
> versus non-physician-staffed (Standard-HEMS) in patients with STEMI.
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 1

The researchers 

> ...studied 398 STEMI patients transferred by either Physician-HEMS ($n=327$) or Standard-HEMS ($n=71$) 
> for [...] intervention at 2 hospitals between 2006 and 2014.
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 1

Since the study is an observational study 
(patients were not allocated by the researchers to the type of helicopter transport),
the researchers recorded information about the patients being transported.
They compared the patients in both groups,
and found (for example) that both groups had similar average ages, 
a similar percentage of females,
a similar percentage of smokers,
and so on.
They also compared information about the transportation,
and found (for example) that both groups had similar average flight times and flight distances.

One conclusion from the study was that 
'Patients with STEMI transported by Standard-HEMS had longer transport times' (p. 1),
but one limitation of the study was that:

> The patient cohorts received treatment by 2 different care teams at two hospitals, 
> which is a potential confounder despite similar baseline characteristics
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 5

In other words,
the difference between hospitals and the staff may have been a confounding variable.
```








## Carry-over effect and washout periods {#CarryOverEffectObservational}

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

The carry-over effect is a possible compromise to internal validity in observational studies.
However, since treatments are not *allocated* in observational studies,
carry-over effects may be difficult to prevent.

It may be possible, however,
to *observe* individuals who are exposed to Condition A then Condition B,
and other individuals who are exposed to Condition B and then Condition A.



```{example, CarryoverObs, name = "Carry-over effects"}
A study of the carry-over effect in ecological observational studies gave many examples, including:
  
> individuals occupying poor quality winter habitat may experience reduced reproductive success 
> the following breeding season when compared to individuals occupying high quality winter habitat.

## Design biases {#OtherBiasesObs}

CROSS REFREENCE/DEFINITION *************************************************************************************************************

(LOTS REPEATED FROM EXP)

Remember the goal of study design:
To isolate the relationship we wish to study
by eliminating, as well as possible, all other possible explanations.

*Bias* refers to any misrepresentation that can lead to a false conclusion,
and may occur *intentionally* or *unintentionally*. 

This may occur during:

* [Data collection](#bias-in-selecting-samples);
* Data analysis; or
* [Interpreting](#Interpretation) and reporting results.

The [*Catalogue of Bias* list over 60 different ways that studies can be biased]
though, in this book, we will only focus on small number of possible biases to consider when designing studies.


## Hawthorne effect and blinding individuals {#HawthorneEffectObservational}

<!-- Text wrap from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43551312/wrap-text-around-plots-in-markdown -->

include_graphics("Pics/iconmonstr-binoculars-8-240.png")
```
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

In observational studies,
individuals *may* or *may not* know they are being observed.
For example,
in an observational study where subjects' blood pressure is measured [@verdecchia1995cigarette],
subjects clearly will know that they are being observed.
This has the potential to alter the data being recorded, and hence compromise internal validity.

As with experimental studies,
efforts should be made to ensure that individuals 
do not know that they are being observed
(that is, that the participants are [*blinded*](#Blinding)).

```{example, HawthorneHH,  name="Hawthorne effect"}
One study
[@wu2018identifying]
examined hand hygiene (HH) in a tertiary teaching hospital,
using *covert* observers 
(that is, the observers were not obviously watching the hand hygiene practices of staff)
and *overt* observers 
(that is, the observers were obvious about watching 
the hand hygiene practices of staff).
One conclusions was that

> The overall HH compliance was higher with 
> overt observation than with covert observation (78% vs. 55%)...
>
> --- @wu2018identifying, p. 369
   
In other words,
people's behaviour changed markedly when people knew they were being observed.
This could easily change the observed relationship between the response and explanatory variables,
and hence compromise internal validity.
```




## Placebo effect and using controls {#PlaceboEffectObservational}


The [placebo effect](#PlaceboEffectExperimental) is concerned with *treatments*,
so are not directly relevant to observational studies.

<!-- Text wrap from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43551312/wrap-text-around-plots-in-markdown -->
<!-- Trick from: https://blog.earo.me/2019/10/26/reduce-frictions-rmd/ -->

include_graphics("Pics/iconmonstr-help-3-240.png")
```
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

However, observational studies can still have a control group,
but the individuals are not randomly *allocated* to the control group.

For example,
in the Doll \& Hill smoking study [@data:DollHill1950:Smoking],
two groups were being compared:
non-smokers (the control group) and smokers.

Subjects were *not allocated* to the groups, however,
so confounding remains a possibility.
Again,
the groups in the study can be compared
(Example \@ref(exm:ActiveSedentaryWomen))
to see if the groups are different in other ways.






## Observer expectancy effect {#ObserverEffectObservational}

<!-- Text wrap from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43551312/wrap-text-around-plots-in-markdown -->
<!-- Trick from: https://blog.earo.me/2019/10/26/reduce-frictions-rmd/ -->
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`

include_graphics("Pics/iconmonstr-idea-10-240.png")
```
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

Observer expectancy can be an issue in observational as well as experimental studies.
For example,
consider a study where the blood pressure of smokers and non-smokers is recorded
[@verdecchia1995cigarette].

This is an observational study 
(individuals cannot be allocated to be a smoker or non-smoker),
but if the researchers *know* whether or not the individual is a smoker when they record the blood pressure,
then observer bias could still come into play (recalling that observer bias is an *unconscious* effect).

In this example,
observer bias could be managed
if the researchers *first* measured the blood pressure,
and *then* asked if the individual was a smoker or not.
That is,
the researchers may be able to be [*blinded*](#Blinding)
to whether or not the subject is a smoker.

This may only be partially successful;
the researcher may see the subject carrying a packet of cigarettes,
or can smell smoke on their breath, for example;
nonetheless,
it may prove at least partially successful,
and is easy to implement.





```{example, ObsBiasObs, name = "Observer-expectancy effect"}
In a study of animal moulting [@zimova2020using], researchers took photos of snowshoe hares,
at various stages of moulting and in various environmental conditions.
Eighteen independent observers were asked to rate the moult stage from the photographs.

The article state that: 

> All images were randomly named and sorted, with the dates and manufacturer's logos removed to minimize observer expectancy bias.

```


```{example, BlindingObs, name = "Blinding in ecology"}

Blinding the observer is not always possible, but should be used when possible
to improve the internal validity of the study.

(reducing the impact of the Hawthorne effect), 
though clearly the participants knew they were involved in a study
(so the impact was not completely eliminated).

However,
the study was criticised
[@radun2018bicycle],
since it was possible that

## Summary {#Chap8-Summary}

Designing effective *observational* studies
requires researchers to maximise internal validity.
This can be achieved by **managing confounding** where possible,
as confounding is often a major threat to the internal validity of observational studies.
This can be managed 
by *restricting* the study to certain groups,
by *blocking*,
or
through special *analysis* methods.
Random allocation is not possible in observational studies.
For this reason,
observing, measuring, assessing or recording 
all the information that is likely to be important 
for understanding the data is important,
usually to be used in analysis.

Well-designed observational studies
also try to manage
the **carry-over effect**,
the **Hawthorne effect**,
**observer bias**,
and
the **placebo effect**,
though the means of doing so are often not under the control of the researchers.







## Quick review questions {#Chap8-QuickReview}

*Formwork* is used in construction using reinforced concrete.
It is complicated and labour intensive. 
An observational study
[@mine2015observational]
examined the relationship between 
the floor area of the building (in m^2^ per storey)
and 
the number of hours of labour needed for the construction
(in person-minutes per storey).

The researchers also recorded,
among other things: 

* the average age of the workers (in years);
* the average years of experience of the workers (in years); and
* the storey height (in meters)

for each of $n=15$ multi-storey buildings in the study.
Some data was obtained from

> ... interviews [..] conducted with the relevant 
> person-in-charge of scheduling for each project.

To record the number of person-hours of labour:

> of 2 to 40 workers. 
> Observations were carried out continuously from

1. The *explanatory variable* is  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	answer = "Floor area",
	"Hours of labour",
	"Average age of workers",
	"Average years of experience of workers",
	"Storey height"))}`
1. The *response variable* is  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	"Floor area",
	answer = "Hours of labour",
	"Average age of workers",
	"Average years of experience of workers",
	"Storey height"))}`
1. What is the *best* description for the 
variable 'Average age of the workers'?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	"A confounding variable, since it is likely to be related to the explanatory variable only",
	"A confounding variable, since it is likely to be related to the response variable only",
	answer = "An extraneous variable, because it is likely to be related to the response variable only",

## Exercises {#DesigningObservationalExercises}

Selected answers are available in
Sect. \@ref(DesigningObservationalAnswer).


```{exercise ResearchDesignTasteOfWater}
Consider this RQ
(based on @teillet2010consumer):

> Among university students,
> is the taste of tap water
> different than the taste of bottled water?

You want to answer this question using an *observational study*.
Describe what these might look like for this study:

1. Random allocation.
1. Blinding.
1. Double blinding.
1. Control.
1. Finding a random sample.

```


```{exercise ResearchDesignControls}
Is it possible to have a control group in an observational study?
Explain.
```

```{exercise ResearchDesignHawthorneEffect}
Is the Hawthorne effect 
only a (potential) issue
in experimental studies?
Explain.
```



```{exercise ResearchDesignSleep}
A study of how well hospital patients sleep at night
[@delaney2018they]
had the stated aim
'to investigate the perceived duration and quality of patient sleep [...] in hospital'.
In discussing the limitations of the study,
the researchers state:
   
> The researchers made no attempt to deceive clinical staff regarding the nature of the study 
> so the influence of the Hawthorne Effect should be considered. 
> The presence of the observer and environmental monitoring equipment in the clinical environment 
> could have altered behaviour among patients and nursing staff 
> seeking to conform to the presumed research objectives. 
> As a result, the findings reported may be an underestimation 
> of the magnitude of the issues that affect sleep.
>
> --- (@delaney2018they p. 7)

Discuss these limitations in terms of the language used in this chapter.
