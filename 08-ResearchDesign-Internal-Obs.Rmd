```{block2, type="rmdobjectives"}
So far,
you have learnt to
ask a RQ, 
identify different ways of obtaining data, and design the study.

**In this chapter**, 
you will learn how to ensure that the 
conclusions we can make are logical and sound in *observational* studies. 
You will learn to:

* maximise the internal validity of observational studies.
* manage confounding in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the carry-over effect in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the Hawthorne effect in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the observer effect in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the placebo effect in observational studies.

## Introduction {#Chap8-Intro}

In experimental studies,
many aspects of the study design typically can be controlled by the researcher,
so experimental studies are often easier to design to maximise internal validity.
However,
*observational studies* have fewer design features that can be controlled by the researchers.

For example,
treatments are not imposed in observational studies,
so random allocation of treatments is impossible,
and hence *confounding* is always a potential threat
to internal validity in observational studies.

Nonetheless,
researchers should still consider aspects of research design
when designing observational studies,
and manage those aspects when possible.

 

```{lemma ObservationalStudiesSmoke, name="Observational studies"}
@doll1954mortality
wrote to a large number of British doctors,
and asked how much they smoked.
Then they observed smokers and non-smokers for many years,
and recorded who died of lung cancer.

Why is this is an observational study?
```



```{r echo=FALSE}
Observational <- "Because the value of the explanatory variable ('whether or not the doctor smoked') is not determined by the researcher. That would be unethical."
if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
Observational <- foldLaTeXText
}
```

```{block2, type="fold"}
(ref:Observationalr)
```




## Managing confounding {#ObsManagingConfounding}

In Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding)
different methods were listed for managing confounding
in experimental studies.
Some, but not all, of these are still possible in observational studies:

* [**Restricting**](#ObsConfoundingRestricting) the study to a certain group 
  (for example, only people under 30).
* [**Blocking**](#ObsConfoundingBlocking).
  Analyse the data separately for different groups 
  (for example, analyse the data separately for people under 30, and 30 and over).
* [**Analysing**](#ObsManagingConfoundingAnalysis)
  using special methods 
  (after measuring the age of each subject).
* [**Randomly allocating**](#ObsConfoundingRandomAllocating)
  people to groups:
  Not possible in observational studies.



### Restrictions {#ObsConfoundingRestricting}

As with experimental studies,
observational studies can be restricted to certain parts of the population.
For example,
in the smoking study of 
@doll1954mortality,
participants were restricted to males aged under 35 years
since, at the time of the study:

> ... lung cancer is
> relatively uncommon in women and
> rare in men under 35 [and]
> useful figures are unlikely to be
> obtained in these groups for some years to come.
>
> --- @doll1954mortality, p. 1452.

The reason for the restriction should be justified if possible
(as shown in the quote above).




###  Blocking {#ObsConfoundingBlocking}

Blocking can be used with observational studies;
for example,
those aged under 30 and those aged 30 or over
could be analysed separately.






### Analysis {#ObsManagingConfoundingAnalysis}

The best advice for observational studies
is to **measure, observe, assess or record 
all the information that is likely to be important for understanding the data**.
While this strategy is also useful for experimental studies,
it is particularly important for observational studies,
as managing confounding through analysis 
(Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis))
is often one of the few practical means available.


```{block2, type="rmdimportant"}
*Measure, observe, assess or record* all
all the information that is likely to be important 
for understanding the data.
This may include information about

* the individuals in the study; and 
* the circumstances of the study.

```


```{example name="Analysis"}
In a different smoking study,
@data:DollHill1950:Smoking recorded the 
the social class and place of residence
of each participant,
as potential confounding variables.
```


```{example ConfoundingKiwi, name="Confounding"}
An observational study of 2599 kiwifruit orchards 
[@data:froud2018:kiwifruit]
explored the relationship between the time since a bacterial canker
was first detected (in weeks) 
and the orchard productivity (in tray equivalents per hectare).

The researchers also recorded information such as 
'whether or not the farm was organic',
'elevation of the orchard' 
and
'whether or not general fungicides were used'.
They used these variables in their analysis to manage the 
potential effects of confounding.
Their analysis showed that 
'elevation of the orchard' 
and
'whether or not general fungicides were used'
were important confounding variables,
but 
'whether or not the farm was organic' was not.
```



### Random allocation {#ObsConfoundingRandomAllocating}

In observational studies,
the study conditions are not allocated by the researchers
(at random or otherwise),
so random allocation of treatments is not possible

For this reason,
confounding is often a major threat to internal validity in observational studies,
as individuals who are in one group may be different (in terms of the response variable)
to those who are in another group
(Table \@ref(tab:SedentaryDemographics)).
As a result,
researchers often summarise the groups 
being compared on various potential confounding variables.


```{example, ActiveSedentaryWomen, name="Comparing study groups"}
In an observational study comparing the 
iron levels of active and sedentary women aged 18 to 35
[@data:woolf:ironstatus],
the authors compared the 
active women ($n=28$) to the sedentary women ($n=28$) 
on a variety of characteristics.

However,
maybe the intrinsic physical differences between 
the women in the the two groups 
might explain any differences found
between iron levels in two two groups.

To determine this,
the researchers examined many characteristics of the women;
some are shown in 
Table \@ref(tab:SedentaryDemographics).
 d
They conclude that active women in their sample 
tended to be (in general) slightly younger, 
slightly heavier and taller, and
slightly more likely to use hormonal contraceptives.
Hence,
any difference in iron levels between the two groups
may be because of the active/sedentary nature of the groups,
or because the active group was (in general) younger,
for example.
```


	
```{r echo=FALSE, SedentaryDemographics}
WomenIron <- array( dim=c(4, 3) )
colnames(WomenIron) <- c("Characteristic", "Active women", "Sedentary women")

WomenIron[1, ] <- c("Average age (in years)", "20", "24")
WomenIron[2, ] <- c("Average height (in cm)", "169", "166")
WomenIron[3, ] <- c("Average weight (in kg)", "68", "62")
WomenIron[4, ] <- c("Percentage using hormonal contraceptives", "13", "11")

  
if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  kable(WomenIron,
        format = "latex",
        longtable = FALSE,
        booktabs = TRUE,
        escape = FALSE, # For latex to work in \rightarrow
        linesep = c("", "", "", "", "", ""), # Otherwise addes a space after five lines... 
        caption = "The demographic information for those in the study of iron levels in women",
        align = "r")   %>%
   kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 10) %>%
  row_spec(0,bold=TRUE) # Columns headings in bold
#   column_spec(column=1, bold=TRUE) 
#   column_spec(column=2, width="500mm") %>%
#   column_spec(column=3, width="25mm")
}

if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
  kable(WomenIron,
        format = "html",
        align = "r",
        longtable = FALSE,
      caption = "The demographic information for those in the study of iron levels in women",
      booktabs = TRUE) # %>%
   #row_spec(row=1, bold=TRUE) %>%
#   column_spec(column=1, bold=TRUE)
   
}
```









```{block2, type="exampleExtra"}
In the smoking study of
@doll1954mortality,
doctors who chose to smoke may be inclined to undertake other
risky behaviours,
whereas those doctors who choose *not* to smoke
may also be inclined to *not* undertake other risky behaviours.
It may be those *other* risky behaviours that lead to 
lung cancer, and not the smoking itself.

In a different smoking study,
@data:DollHill1950:Smoking
used a control group.
The control group was chosen to be very similar to those in the lung-cancer group,
in terms of age and sex.
(That is,
the numbers of females and males within each age group
was very similar for those with lung cancer, and those without lung cancer.)
```


```{block2, type="rmdimportant"}
Observational studies *can* (and often do) have control groups.
Indeed,
one specific type of observational study is called 
a [*case-control study*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case%E2%80%93control_study). 

However,
individuals are not *allocated* to the control group by the researchers
in observational studies.
```





```{block2, type="exampleExtra"}
A study [@data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter]
examined the difference between two types of 
helicopter transfer (physician-staffed; non-physician-staffed) of patients 
with a specific type of myocardial infarction (STEMI).
The purpose of the study was:

> ...to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of physician-staffed HEMS (Physician-HEMS) 
> versus non-physician-staffed (Standard-HEMS) in patients with STEMI.
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 1

The researchers 

> ...studied 398 STEMI patients transferred by either Physician-HEMS ($n=327$) or Standard-HEMS ($n=71$) 
> for [...] intervention at 2 hospitals between 2006 and 2014.
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 1

Since the study is an observational study 
(patients were not allocated by the researchers to the type of helicopter transport),
the researchers recorded information about the patients being transported.
They compared the patients in both groups,
and found (for example) that both groups had similar average ages, 
a similar percentages of females,
a similar percentage of smokers,
and so on.
They also compared information about the transportation,
and found (for example) that both groups had similar average flight times and flight distances.

One conclusion from the study was that 
'Patients with STEMI transported by Standard-HEMS had longer transport times' (p. 1),
but one limitation of the study was that:

> The patient cohorts received treatment by 2 different care teams at two hospitals, 
> which is a potential confounder despite similar baseline characteristics
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 5

In other words,
the difference between hospitals and the staff may have been a confounding variable.
```






## Other design considerations {#DesignConsiderationsObservational}

Many issues must be kept in mind when designing studies,
such as selecting the sample and managing confounding.
In this section, 
some specific design considerations are discussed:

* [The carry-over effect](#CarryOverEffectObservational);
* [The Hawthorne effect](#HawthorneEffectObservational);
* [The placebo effect](#PlaceboEffectObservational); and
* [The observer effect](#ObserverEffectObservationall).

Not every design consideration will be relevant to every study.



### Carry-over effect {#CarryOverEffectObservational}

<!-- Text wrap from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43551312/wrap-text-around-plots-in-markdown -->
<!-- Trick from: https://blog.earo.me/2019/10/26/reduce-frictions-rmd/ -->
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width= "10%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
include_graphics("Pics/iconmonstr-chart-21-240.png")
```
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

Since treatments are not allocated in observational studies,
carry-over effects may be present in some observational studies.
It may be possible, however,
to observe individuals who are exposed to Condition A then Condition B,
and other individuals who are exposed to Condition B and then Condition A.



### Hawthorne effect {#HawthorneEffectObservational}

<!-- Text wrap from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43551312/wrap-text-around-plots-in-markdown -->
<!-- Trick from: https://blog.earo.me/2019/10/26/reduce-frictions-rmd/ -->

include_graphics("Pics/iconmonstr-binoculars-8-240.png")
```
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

In observational studies,
individuals may know they are being observed.
For example,
in an observational study where subjects' blood pressure is measured [@verdecchia1995cigarette],
subjects clearly will know that they are being observed.
As with experimental studies,
efforts should be made to ensure that individuals 
do not know that they are being observed
(that is, that the participants are *blinded*).

```
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`



```{example name="Hawthorne effect"}
One study
[@wu2018identifying]
examined hand hygiene (HH) in a tertiary teaching hospital,
using *covert* observers 
(that is, the observers were not obviously watching the hand hygiene practices of staff)
and *overt* observers 
(that is, the observers were obvious about watching the hand hygiene practices of staff).
One conclusions was that

> The overall HH compliance was higher with 
> overt observation than with covert observation (78% vs. 55%)...
>
> --- @wu2018identifying, p. 369
   
In other words,
people's behaviour changed markedly when people knew they were being observed.
```




### Placebo effect {#PlaceboEffectObservational}

<!-- Text wrap from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43551312/wrap-text-around-plots-in-markdown -->
<!-- Trick from: https://blog.earo.me/2019/10/26/reduce-frictions-rmd/ -->
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width= "10%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
include_graphics("Pics/iconmonstr-help-3-240.png")
```
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

Observational studies can still have a control group,
but the individuals are not randomly *allocated* to the control group.
For example,
in the Doll \& Hill smoking study [@data:DollHill1950:Smoking],
two groups were being compared:
non-smokers (the control group) and smokers.
Subjects were *not allocated* to the groups, however,
so confounding remains a possibility.
Again,
the groups in the study can be compared
(Example \@ref(exm:ActiveSedentaryWomen))
to see if the groups are different in other ways.




### Observer effect {#ObserverEffectObservationall}

<!-- Text wrap from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43551312/wrap-text-around-plots-in-markdown -->
<!-- Trick from: https://blog.earo.me/2019/10/26/reduce-frictions-rmd/ -->
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width= "10%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
include_graphics("Pics/iconmonstr-idea-10-240.png")
```
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

The observer effect can be an issue in observational as well as experimental studies.
For example,
consider a study where the blood pressure of smokers and non-smokers is recorded
[@verdecchia1995cigarette].

This is an observational study 
(individuals cannot be allocated to be a smoker or non-smoker),
but if the researchers know whether or not the individual
is a smoker when they record the blood pressure,
then the observer effect could still come into play
(recalling that the observer effect is an *unconscious* effect).

In this example,
the observer effect could be managed
if the researchers *first* measured the blood pressure,
and *then* asked if the individual was a smoker or not.
That is,
the researchers may be able to be *blinded*
to whether or not the subject is a smoker.

This may only be partially successful;
the researcher may see the subject carrying a packet of cigarettes,
or can smell smoke on their breath, for example;
nonetheless,
it may prove at least partially successful,
and is easy to implement.


```{block2, type="exampleExtra"}
A study 
[@gamble2016wearing]
found that bicycle riders who *wear* helmets are more likely to take risks
compared to bicycle riders who *do not wear* helmets.
The paper states that the bicycle riders were blinded to the *purpose* of the study
(reducing the impact of the Hawthorne effect), 
though clearly the participants knew they were involved in a study
(so the impact was not completely eliminated).
However,
the study was criticised
[@radun2018bicycle],
since it was possible that

> ... the experimenters unconsciously conveyed 
> their expectations to participants and thereby affected their responses [...] 
> it is clear that the double-blind procedure has been developed 
> for a reason and should have been used in this study.
>
> --- @radun2018bicycle, p. 1020

```




## Summary {#Chap8-Summary}

Designing effective *observational* studies
requires researchers to maximise internal validity.
This can be achieved by **managing confounding** where possible,
as confounding is often a major threat to the internal validity of observational studies.
This can be managed 
by *restricing* the study to certain groups,
by *blocking*,
or
through special *analysis* methods.
Random allocation is not possible in observational studies.
For this reason,
observing, measuring, assessing or recording 
all the information that is likely to be important 
for understanding the data is important,
usually to be used in analysis.

Well-designed observational studies
also try to manage the effects of 
the **carry-over effect**,
the **Hawthorne effect**,
the **observer effect**,
and
the **placebo effect**,
though the means of doing so are often not under the control of the researchers.







## Quick review questions {#Chap8-QuickReview}

*Formwork* is used in construction using reinforced concrete.
It is complicated and labour intensive. 
An observational study
[@mine2015observational]
examined the relationship between 
the floor area of the building (in m^2^ per storey)
and 
the number of hours of labour needed for the construction
(in person-minutes per storey).

The researchers also recorded,
among other things: 

* the average age of the workers (in years);
* the average years of experience of the workers (in years); and
* the storey height (in meters)

for each of $n=15$ multi-storey buildings in the study.
Some data was obtained from

> ... interviews [..] conducted with the relevant 
> person-in-charge of scheduling for each project.
>
> --- @mine2015observational, p. 2

To record the number of person-hours of labour:

> Two observers made the site rounds observation 
> of 2 to 40 workers. 
> Observations were carried out continuously from
> the start to the end of work, 
> excluding lunch time.
>

	answer = "An extraneous variable, because it is likely to be related to the response variable only",
	"A lurking variable, since we don't know how it might be related to the response and explanatory variables"))}`
1. What is the most likely way in which confounding would be managed in this study?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	"Restricting, the study to multi-storey buildings",
	"Blocking, by only studying unit blocks",
	answer = "Analysis, by using other recorded variables in the analysis",
