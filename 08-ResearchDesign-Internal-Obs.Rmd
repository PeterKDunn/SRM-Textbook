## Introduction {#Chap8-Intro}

In experimental studies, many aspects of the study design typically can be controlled by the researcher, so experimental studies are often easier to design to maximise [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity).
In contrast, *observational studies* have fewer design features that can be controlled by the researchers.
For example, since treatments are not imposed in observational studies, random allocation of treatments is impossible, and hence *confounding* is always a potential threat to [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity) in observational studies.

Nonetheless, researchers should still consider aspects of research design when designing observational studies, and manage those aspects when possible to maximise the internal validity.
Specific design strategies that we consider for maximising [internally validity](#def:InternalValidity) are:

* Managing confounding (Sect. \@ref(ObsManagingConfounding)).
* Managing the carry-over effect (Sect. \@ref(CarryOverEffectObservational)).
* Managing the Hawthorne effect (Sect. \@ref(HawthorneEffectObservational)).
* Managing the placebo effect (Sect. \@ref(PlaceboEffectObservational)).
* Managing the observer effect (Sect. \@ref(ObserverEffectObservational)).
* Recording potential extraneous variables (Sect. \@ref(RecordExtraneousObservational)).

Not every design consideration will be relevant to every study.

Remember the goal of study design: To design a study to isolate the relationship of interest, by eliminating, as far as possible, all other possible explanations.

The authors of a study [@clausen2017effect] teaching integrated pest management (IPM) to Ugandan small-scale farmers noted that

> The neighboring farmers were supposed to represent the average farmer living in the intervention subdistrict after IPM training... 
> They were, however, different from the control farmers according to some demographic and agricultural characteristics---e.g., more neighboring farmers lived in Pallisa, were women, had a higher education and were members of a farmers' group, which were all possible confounders in the study [...]

Despite low internal validity, the study still showed some promising signs of teaching IPM to be explored in future studies.

@doll1954mortality wrote to a large number of British doctors, and asked how much they smoked.
Then they observed smokers and non-smokers for many years, and recorded who died of lung cancer.

## Managing confounding {#ObsManagingConfounding}

In Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding) different methods were listed for managing confounding in experimental studies.
Some, but not all, of these are still possible in observational studies:

* [**Restricting**](#ObsConfoundingRestricting) the study to a certain group (for example, only people under 30).
* [**Blocking**](#ObsConfoundingBlocking).
  Analyse the data separately for different groups (for example, analyse the data separately for people under 30, and 30 and over).
* [**Analysing**](#ObsManagingConfoundingAnalysis) using special methods (after measuring the age of each subject).
* [**Randomly allocating**](#ObsConfoundingRandomAllocating) people to groups: Not possible in observational studies.

Since random allocation is not possible for observational studies, confounding is often a serious potential limitation in observational studies.


:::{.example #ConfoundingChildbirth name="Deaths in childbirth"}
In the 1800s, Ignac Semmelweis noted following mortality rates of women after childbirth over many years (based on @dunn2005ignac):

* Clinic 1, with male doctors delivering babies: 9.9%.
* Clinic 2, with female midwives delivering babies: 3.4%.

Is the difference in mortality rate (the response variable) due to the sex of the person delivering the babies (the epxlanatory variable)?

One possible explanation is that the Clinic may have been a confounding variable; however, Semmelweis eliminated the clinic as an explanation.
For example, Clinic 2 was actually more overcrowded than Clinic 1, and the climate was similar for both clinics.

However, another important *lurking variable* was present.
In the 1800s, the benefits of hand washing were not understood, nor commonplace, and Semmelweis found that many (male) doctors had performed autopsies before delivering babies, without washing their hands between the two procedures.
In contrast, autopsies were not performed by (female) nurses.

The lurking variable was 'whether the baby was delivered by someone with clean hands', which was related to the mortality rate *and* to the sex of the person delivering the baby.
The female midwives had clean hands, and hence the mortality rate was (relatively) low.
The male doctors did *not* have clean hands, and hence the mortality rate was high.

After instituting hand washing for doctors, the mortality rate reduced in Clinic 1.
::: 


### Restrictions {#ObsConfoundingRestricting}

As with experimental studies, observational studies can be restricted to certain parts of the population.
For example, in the smoking study of @doll1954mortality, participants were restricted to males aged under 35 years since, at the time of the study, "lung cancer [was] relatively uncommon in women and rare in men under 35" (@doll1954mortality, p. 1452).
The reason for the restriction should be justified if possible (as shown in the quote above).


###  Blocking {#ObsConfoundingBlocking}

Blocking can be used with observational studies; for example, those aged under 30 and those aged 30 or over could be analysed separately.
This, of course, requires the age of the participants to be known to the researchers.


### Analysis {#ObsManagingConfoundingAnalysis}

The best advice for observational studies is to *record all extraneous variables likely to be important for understanding the data*.
This is particularly important for observational studies, as managing confounding through analysis (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis)) is often one of the few practical means available.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
*Record* all extraneous variables likely to be important for understanding the data.
This may include information about the *individuals* in the study, and the *circumstances* of the individuals in the study.
:::


::: {.example #ConfoundingKiwi name="Confounding"}
An observational study of 2599 kiwifruit orchards [@data:froud2018:kiwifruit] explored the relationship between the time since a bacterial canker was first detected (in weeks), and the orchard productivity (in tray equivalents per hectare).
The researchers also recorded information such as 'whether or not the farm was organic', 'elevation of the orchard' and 'whether or not general fungicides were used'.
These variables were used in their analysis to manage the potential effects of confounding.
:::


### Random allocation {#ObsConfoundingRandomAllocating}

In observational studies, allocation of treatments is not possible.
For this reason, confounding is often a major threat to [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity) in observational studies, as individuals who are in one group may be different to those who are in another group (Table \@ref(tab:SedentaryDemographics)).
As a result, researchers often summarise the groups being compared on various potential confounding variables.


::: {.example #ActiveSedentaryWomen name="Comparing study groups"}
An observational study compared the iron levels of active and sedentary women aged 18 to 35 [@data:woolf:ironstatus].
In case the intrinsic physical differences between the women in the two groups might explain any differences found between iron levels in two two groups,
the active ($n = 28$) and sedentary women ($n = 28$) were compared on a variety of characteristics (Table \@ref(tab:SedentaryDemographics)).

They conclude that active women in their sample tended to be (in general) slightly younger, slightly heavier and taller, and slightly more likely to use hormonal contraceptives.
Hence, any difference in iron levels between the two groups may be because of the active/sedentary nature of the groups, *or* because the active group was (in general) younger, for example.
:::


```{r echo=FALSE, SedentaryDemographics}

:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
In the smoking study of @doll1954mortality, doctors who *chose* to smoke may also undertake other risky behaviours, whereas those doctors who choose *not* to smoke may also be inclined to *not* undertake other risky behaviours.
It may be those *other* risky behaviours that lead to  lung cancer, and not the smoking itself.

In another smoking study, @data:DollHill1950:Smoking used a control group.
The control group was chosen to include very similar individuals to those in the lung-cancer group, in terms of age and sex.
(That is, the numbers of females and males within each age group was very similar for those with lung cancer, and those without lung cancer.)
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Observational studies *can* (and often do) have control groups.
Indeed, one specific type of observational study is called a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '*case-control study*.'
} else {
   '[*case-control study*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case%E2%80%93control_study).'
}`
However, individuals are not *allocated* to the control group by the researchers in observational studies.
:::


:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
A study [@data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter] examined the difference between two types of helicopter transfer (physician-staffed; non-physician-staffed) of patients  with a specific type of myocardial infarction (STEMI).
The purpose of the study was:

> ...to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of physician-staffed HEMS (Physician-HEMS) versus non-physician-staffed (Standard-HEMS) in patients with STEMI.
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 1

The researchers 

> ...studied 398 STEMI patients transferred by either Physician-HEMS ($n = 327$) or Standard-HEMS ($n = 71$) for [...] intervention at 2 hospitals between 2006 and 2014.
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 1

Since the study is an observational study (patients were not allocated by the researchers to the type of helicopter transport), the researchers recorded information about the patients being transported.
They compared the patients in both groups, and found (for example) that both groups had similar average ages, and similar percentages of females and smokers, and so on.
They also compared information about the transportation, and found (for example) that both groups had similar average flight times and flight distances.

One conclusion from the study was that 'Patients with STEMI transported by Standard-HEMS had longer transport times' (p. 1), but one limitation of the study was that:

> The patient cohorts received treatment by 2 different care teams at two hospitals, which is a potential confounder despite similar baseline characteristics
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 5

In other words, the difference between hospitals and the staff may have been a confounding variable.
:::


## Carry-over effect and washout periods {#CarryOverEffectObservational}


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-chart-21-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


The carry-over effect is a possible compromise to internal validity in observational studies.
However, since treatments are not *allocated* in observational studies, carry-over effects may be difficult to prevent.
It may be possible, however, to *observe* individuals who are exposed to Condition A then Condition B, and other individuals who are exposed to Condition B and then Condition A.


::: {.example #CarryoverObs name="Carry-over effects"}
A study of the carry-over effect in ecological observational studies of animals gave many examples, including:
  
> ...individuals occupying poor quality winter habitat may experience reduced reproductive success the following breeding season when compared to individuals occupying high quality winter habitat. 
>
> --- @norris2005carry, p. 181
:::


## Hawthorne effect and blinding individuals {#HawthorneEffectObservational}


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-binoculars-8-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


In observational studies, individuals *may* or *may not* know they are being observed.
For example, in an observational study where subjects' blood pressure is measured [@verdecchia1995cigarette], subjects clearly know they are being observed, which  has the potential to alter how the subjects behave (for example, people become more tense, called 'white-coat hypertension'; @pickering2002white).
As with experimental studies, efforts should be made to ensure that individuals do not know that they are being observed (the participants are [*blinded*](#Blinding)).



::: {.example #HawthorneHH  name="Hawthorne effect"}
A study [@wu2018identifying] examined hand hygiene (HH) in a tertiary teaching hospital, using:

* *covert* observers (the observers were not obviously watching the hand hygiene practices of staff); and
*  *overt* observers (the observers were obvious about watching the hand hygiene practices of staff).

One conclusions was that compliance with HH was "higher with overt observation than with covert observation (78% vs. 55%)..." (@wu2018identifying, p. 369).
People's behaviour changed substantially when people knew they were being observed.
This could easily change the observed relationship between the response and explanatory variables, and hence compromise internal validity.
:::


## Placebo effect and using controls {#PlaceboEffectObservational}


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-help-3-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


The [placebo effect](#PlaceboEffectExperimental) is concerned with *treatments*, so are not directly relevant to observational studies.
Observational studies can still have a control group, but the individuals are not randomly *allocated* to the control group.
For example, in the Doll \& Hill smoking study [@data:DollHill1950:Smoking], two groups were being compared: non-smokers (the control group) and smokers.
Subjects were *not allocated* to the groups, however, so confounding remains a possibility.
Again, the groups in the study can be compared (Example \@ref(exm:ActiveSedentaryWomen)) to see if the groups are different in other ways.


## Observer effect and blinding researchers {#ObserverEffectObservational}


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-idea-10-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


The observer effect can impact observational as well as experimental studies.
For example, consider a study where the blood pressure of smokers and non-smokers is recorded [@verdecchia1995cigarette].
This is an observational study (individuals cannot be allocated to be a smoker or non-smoker), but if the researchers *know* whether or not the individual is a smoker when they record the blood pressure, then the observer effect could still impact the results (recalling that the observer effect is an *unconscious* effect).
For example, the researchers may *expect* smokers to have a high blood pressure.

The observer effect could be managed if the researchers *first* measured the blood pressure, and *then* asked if the individual was a smoker or not.
That is, the researchers may be able to be [*blinded*](#Blinding) to whether or not the subject is a smoker when they take blood pressure measurements.
This may only be partially successful; the researcher may see the subject carrying a packet of cigarettes, or can smell smoke on their breath, for example.
Nonetheless, it may prove at least partially successful, and is easy to implement.


::: {.example #ObsEffectObs name="Observer effect"}
In a study of animal moulting [@zimova2020using], researchers took photos of snowshoe hares, at various stages of moulting and in various environmental conditions.
Eighteen independent observers were asked to rate the moult stage from the photographs.
The article state that: 

> All images were randomly named and sorted, with the dates and manufacturer's logos removed to minimize observer expectancy bias [i.e., the observer effect].
>
> --- @zimova2020using, p. 4
:::


::: {.example #BlindingObs name="Blinding in ecology"}
A study of research articles in ecology found that:

> ... 50.4% ($n = 248$) to have potential for observer bias, but only 13.3% ($n = 33$ of $248$) of these articles stated use of blind observation. 
>
> --- @kardish2015blind; line breaks added

Blinding the observer is not always possible, but should be used when it is possible to improve the internal validity of the study.
:::


::: {.example #BlindingScats name="Observer effect"}
A study of the scats of gray wolves was used to study their diet [@SpauldingScats].
A scat analysis is where humans examine the scat of carnivores, and hence determine the prey.
However, the accuracy of the results was questioned, due to

> ... improper training, intentional incomplete analysis, [...] and perpetuation of the assumption that wolf scats contain only 1 prey item/scat...
>
> --- @SpauldingScats, p. 949

The observers might be seeing what they expect to see: that "wolf scats contain only 1 prey item/scat".
:::


::: {.example name="Blinding in ecology"}
A study [@gamble2016wearing] found that bicycle riders who *wear* helmets are more likely to take risks compared to bicycle riders who *do not wear* helmets.
The bicycle riders were blinded to the *purpose* of the study (reducing the impact of the Hawthorne effect), though clearly the participants knew they were involved in a study (so the impact was not completely eliminated).
However, the study was criticised [@radun2018bicycle], since it was possible that

> ... the experimenters unconsciously conveyed their expectations to participants and thereby affected their responses [...] 
> it is clear that the double-blind procedure has been developed for a reason and should have been used in this study.
>
> --- @radun2018bicycle, p. 1020

The lack of [blinding](#Blinding), when it was possible to incorporate blinding, compromised the study's internal validity.
:::


## Comments on blinding {#BlindingObservational}

Many comments about blinding made for experimental studies (Sect. \@ref(DescribingBlinding)) apply for observational studies also. 
In observational studies, blinding individuals *may* be (but is not always) easier than in experimental studies (Sect. \@ref(HawthorneEffectObservational)).
Blinding the researchers may be difficult, since the researchers need to record the value of the explanatory variable.
To blind the researchers, sometimes two different researchers can be used: One to record the value of the response variable, and one to record the value of the explanatory variable.


::: {.example #BlindingDogs  name="Blinding in observational studies"}
In a study of dogs with chronic pancreatitis (CP), the researchers acquired abdominal ultrasounds and pathology results of each dog.
The authors report that the researchers conducting the ultrasounds were not blinded (@watson2010observational, p. 969).
However:

> Tissue samples [...] were obtained from all dogs and re-cut sections were reviewed by one of the authors (PJW) with the help of a veterinary pathologist 
> (AJR or TJS), all blinded to the clinical details of the case, but aware that CP was suspected in each dog...
>
> --- @watson2010observational

This study clearly explains which parts of the study were blinded, and which were not.

> However the examiner was blinded to both the clinical state and group of each subject when the images were reviewed.

## Extraneous variables {#RecordExtraneousObservational}

Recording the values of possible extraneous variables is very important for observational studies, as it one of the few ways available to manage confounding.
The reasons for recording the values of extraneous variables given in Sect. \@ref({#RecordExtraneousObservational}) still apply:

* To compare the sample to the population, to see if the sample is representative (Sect. \@ref(Representative-samples)).
* To explain some variation in the response variable, so that the relationship between the response and explanatory variable can be revealed. (Sect. \@ref(ExtraneousVariables)).
* To manage confounding:
  * To avoid lurking variables (Sect. \@ref(ExtraneousVariables)).
  * To determine if the groups being compared are similar (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding)).
  * To use the information in analysis (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis)).



## Summary {#Chap8-Summary}

Designing effective *observational* studies requires researchers to maximise internal validity.
This can be achieved by *managing confounding* where possible, as confounding is often a major threat to the internal validity of observational studies.
Confounding can be managed by:

* *restricting* the study to certain groups;
* *blocking*; or
* through special *analysis* methods.

Random allocation is not possible in observational studies.
For this reason, observing, measuring, assessing or recording all the information that is likely to be important for understanding the data is important, usually to be used in analysis.
Well-designed observational studies also try to manage

* the *carry-over effect*;
* the *Hawthorne effect*;
* the *placebo effect*; and
* the *observer effect*

though the means of doing so are often not under the control of the researchers.
Recording the values of possible extraneous variables is very important for observational studies.


## Quick review questions {#Chap8-QuickReview}

*Formwork* is used in construction using reinforced concrete, and can be complicated and labour intensive.
An observational study [@mine2015observational] examined the relationship between the floor area of the building (in m^2^ per storey) and the number of hours of labour needed for the construction (in person-minutes per storey).
The researchers also recorded, among other things, the average age of the workers (in years); the average years of experience of the workers (in years); and the storey height (in meters) for each of $n = 15$ multi-storey buildings in the study.

To record the number of person-hours of labour:

> Two observers made the site rounds observation of 2 to 40 workers. 
> Observations were carried out continuously from the start to the end of work, excluding lunch time.
