## Introduction {#Chap8-Intro}

In experimental studies, many aspects of the study design typically can be controlled by the researcher, so experimental studies are often easier to design to maximise [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity).
In contrast, *observational studies* have fewer design features that can be controlled by the researchers.
For example, since treatments are not imposed in observational studies, random allocation of treatments is impossible, and hence *confounding* is always a potential threat to [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity) in observational studies.

Nonetheless, researchers should still consider aspects of research design when designing observational studies, and manage those aspects when possible to maximise the internal validity.
Specific design strategies that we consider for maximising [internally validity](#def:InternalValidity) are:

* Managing confounding (Sect. \@ref(ObsManagingConfounding)).
* Managing the carry-over effect (Sect. \@ref(CarryOverEffectObservational)).
* Managing the Hawthorne effect (Sect. \@ref(HawthorneEffectObservational)).
* Managing the placebo effect (Sect. \@ref(PlaceboEffectObservational)).
* Managing the observer effect (Sect. \@ref(ObserverEffectObservational)).
* Recording potential extraneous variables (Sect. \@ref(RecordExtraneousObservational)).

Not every design issue is relevant to every study.

Remember the goal of study design: To design a study to isolate the relationship of interest, by eliminating, as far as possible, all other possible explanations.

::: {.example name="Low internal validity"}
The authors of a study [@clausen2017effect] teaching integrated pest management (IPM) to Ugandan small-scale farmers noted that (p. 8, 9):

> The neighboring farmers were supposed to represent the average farmer living in the intervention subdistrict after IPM training... 
> They were, however, different from the control farmers according to some demographic and agricultural characteristics---e.g., more neighboring farmers lived in Pallisa, were women, had a higher education and were members of a farmers' group, which were all possible confounders in the study [...]

Despite low internal validity, the study still showed some promising signs of teaching IPM to be explored in future studies.

## Managing confounding {#ObsManagingConfounding}

In Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding) different methods were listed for managing confounding in experimental studies.
Some, but not all, of these are still possible for managing confounding in observational studies:

* [**Restricting**](#ObsConfoundingRestricting) the study to a certain group (for example, only people under 30).
* [**Blocking**](#ObsConfoundingBlocking).
  Analyse the data separately for different groups (for example, analyse the data separately for people under 30, and 30 and over).
* [**Analysing**](#ObsManagingConfoundingAnalysis) using special methods (after measuring the age of each subject).
* [**Randomly allocating**](#ObsConfoundingRandomAllocating) people to groups:* Not possible* in observational studies.

Since random allocation is not possible for observational studies, confounding is often a serious potential limitation in observational studies.


:::{.example #ConfoundingChildbirth name="Deaths in childbirth"}
In the 1800s, Semmelweis noted following mortality rates of women after childbirth over many years (based on @dunn2005ignac):

* Clinic 1, with male doctors delivering babies: 9.9%.
* Clinic 2, with female midwives delivering babies: 3.4%.

Is the difference in mortality rate (the outcome) due to the sex of the person delivering the babies (the comparison)?

One possible explanation is that the Clinic may have been a confounding variable; however, Semmelweis eliminated the clinic as an explanation.
For example, Clinic 2 was actually more overcrowded than Clinic 1, and the climate was similar for both clinics.

However, an important *lurking variable* was present.
In the 1800s, the benefits of hand washing were not understood, nor commonplace, and Semmelweis found that many (male) doctors had performed autopsies before delivering babies, without washing their hands between the two procedures.
In contrast, autopsies were not performed by (female) nurses.

The lurking variable was 'whether the baby was delivered by someone with clean hands', which was related to the mortality rate *and* to the sex of the person delivering the baby.
The female midwives had clean hands, and hence the mortality rate was (relatively) low.
The male doctors did *not* have clean hands, and hence the mortality rate was high.

After instituting hand washing for doctors, the mortality rate in Clinic 1 reduced to a rate similar to that in Clinic 2.
::: 


### Restrictions {#ObsConfoundingRestricting}

As with experimental studies, observational studies can be restricted to parts of the population.
For example, in the smoking study of @doll1954mortality, participants were restricted to males aged under 35 years since, at the time of the study, "lung cancer [was] relatively uncommon in women and rare in men under 35" (@doll1954mortality, p. 1452).
The reason for the restriction should be justified if possible (as shown in this quotation).


###  Blocking {#ObsConfoundingBlocking}

Blocking can be used with observational studies; for example, those aged under 30 and those aged 30 or over could be analysed separately.
This, of course, requires the age of the participants to be recorded by the researchers.


### Analysis {#ObsManagingConfoundingAnalysis}

The best advice for observational studies is to *record all extraneous variables likely to be important for understanding the data*.
This is particularly important for observational studies, as managing confounding through analysis (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis)) is often one of the few practical means available.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
*Record* all extraneous variables likely to be important for understanding the individuals
This may include information *about* the individuals in the study, and the *circumstances* of the individuals in the study.
:::


::: {.example #ConfoundingKiwi name="Confounding"}
An observational study of 2599 kiwifruit orchards [@data:froud2018:kiwifruit] explored the relationship between the time since a bacterial canker was first detected (in weeks), and the orchard productivity (in tray equivalents per hectare).
The researchers also recorded extraneous variables such as 'whether or not the farm was organic', 'elevation of the orchard' and 'whether or not general fungicides were used'.
These variables were used in their analysis to manage the potential effects of confounding.
:::


### Random allocation {#ObsConfoundingRandomAllocating}

In observational studies, allocation of treatments is not possible (or it would be an experimental study).
For this reason, confounding is often a major threat to [internal validity](#def:InternalValidity) in observational studies, as individuals who are in one group may be different, in general, to those who are in another group.
As a result, researchers often summarise the groups being compared on various potential confounding variables.


::: {.example #ActiveSedentaryWomen name="Comparing study groups"}
An observational study compared the iron levels of active and sedentary women aged 18 to 35 [@data:woolf:ironstatus].
The active ($n = 28$) and sedentary women ($n = 28$) were compared on a variety of characteristics (Table \@ref(tab:SedentaryDemographics)).

They conclude that the active women in their sample were (in general) slightly younger, slightly heavier and taller, and slightly more likely to use hormonal contraceptives.
Hence, any difference in iron levels between the two groups may be because of the active/sedentary nature of the groups, *or* because the active group was (in general) younger, for example.
:::


```{r echo=FALSE, SedentaryDemographics}
WomenIron <- array( dim=c(4, 3) )
colnames(WomenIron) <- c("Characteristic", "Active women", "Sedentary women")

:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
In the smoking study of @doll1954mortality, doctors who *chose* to smoke may also undertake other risky behaviours, whereas doctors who choose *not* to smoke may also be inclined to *avoid* other risky behaviours.
It may be those *other* risky behaviours that lead to  lung cancer, and not the smoking itself.

In another smoking study, @data:DollHill1950:Smoking used a control group.
The control group was chosen to include very similar individuals to those in the lung-cancer group, in terms of age and sex.
(That is, the numbers of females and males within each age group was very similar for those with lung cancer, and those without lung cancer.)
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Observational studies *can* (and often do) have control groups.
Indeed, one specific type of observational study is called a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '*case-control study*.'
} else {
   '[*case-control study*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case%E2%80%93control_study).'
}`
However, individuals are *not allocated* to the control group* by the researchers in observational studies.
:::


:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
A study [@data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter] examined the difference between two types of helicopter transfer (physician-staffed; non-physician-staffed) of patients with a specific type of myocardial infarction (STEMI).
The purpose of the study was:

> ...to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of physician-staffed HEMS (Physician-HEMS) versus non-physician-staffed (Standard-HEMS) in patients with STEMI.
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 1

The researchers 

> ...studied 398 STEMI patients transferred by either Physician-HEMS ($n = 327$) or Standard-HEMS ($n = 71$) for [...] intervention at 2 hospitals between 2006 and 2014.
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 1

Since the study is an observational study (patients were not allocated by the researchers to the type of helicopter transport), the researchers recorded information about the patients being transported.
They compared the patients in both groups, and found (for example) that both groups had similar average ages, and similar percentages of females and smokers, and so on.
They also compared information about the transportation, and found (for example) that both groups had similar average flight times and flight distances.

One conclusion from the study was that 'Patients with STEMI transported by Standard-HEMS had longer transport times' (p. 1), but one limitation of the study was that:

> The patient cohorts received treatment by 2 different care teams at two hospitals, which is a potential confounder despite similar baseline characteristics
>
> --- @data:Gunnarsson2017:helicopter, p. 5

In other words, the difference between hospitals and the staff may have been a confounding variable.
:::


## Carry-over effect and washout periods {#CarryOverEffectObservational}


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-chart-21-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


The carry-over effect is a possible compromise to internal validity in observational studies.
However, since treatments are *not allocated* in observational studies, carry-over effects may be difficult to prevent.
It may be possible, however, to *observe* individuals who are exposed to Condition A then Condition B, and other individuals who are exposed to Condition B and then Condition A.


::: {.example #CarryoverObs name="Carry-over effects"}
A study of the carry-over effect in ecological observational studies of animals gave the example of:
  
> ...individuals occupying poor quality winter habitat may experience reduced reproductive success the following breeding season when compared to individuals occupying high quality winter habitat. 
>
> --- @norris2005carry, p. 181
:::


## Hawthorne effect and blinding individuals {#HawthorneEffectObservational}


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-binoculars-8-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


In observational studies, individuals *may* or *may not* know they are being observed.
For example, in an observational study where subjects' blood pressure is measured [@verdecchia1995cigarette], subjects clearly know they are being observed, which has the potential to alter the subjects behaviour (for example, people become tense, called 'white-coat hypertension'; @pickering2002white).
As with experimental studies, efforts should be made to ensure that individuals do not know that they are being observed (the participants are [*blinded*](#Blinding)).



::: {.example #HawthorneHH  name="Hawthorne effect"}
A study [@wu2018identifying] examined hand hygiene (HH) in a tertiary teaching hospital, using:

* *covert* observers (the observers were not obviously watching the hand hygiene practices of staff); and
*  *overt* observers (the observers were obvious about watching the hand hygiene practices of staff).

One conclusions was that compliance with HH was "higher with overt observation than with covert observation (78% vs. 55%)..." (@wu2018identifying, p. 369).
People's behaviour changed substantially when people knew they were being observed.
The relationship between the response and explanatory variables changed depending on whether the participants were being watched, which compromises internal validity.
:::


## Placebo effect and using controls {#PlaceboEffectObservational}


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-help-3-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


The [placebo effect](#PlaceboEffectExperimental) is concerned with *treatments*, so are not directly relevant to observational studies.
Observational studies can still have a control group, but the individuals are not randomly *allocated* to the control group.
For example, in one smoking study [@data:DollHill1950:Smoking], two groups were being compared: non-smokers (the control group) and smokers.
Subjects were *not allocated* to the groups, however, so confounding remains a possibility.
Again, the groups in the study can be compared (Example \@ref(exm:ActiveSedentaryWomen)) to see if the groups are different in other ways.


## Observer effect and blinding researchers {#ObserverEffectObservational}


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-idea-10-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


The observer effect can impact observational as well as experimental studies.
For example, consider a study where the blood pressure of smokers and non-smokers is recorded [@verdecchia1995cigarette].
This is an observational study (individuals cannot be allocated to be a smoker or non-smoker), but if the researchers *know* whether or not the individual is a smoker when they record the blood pressure, then the observer effect could still impact the results (recalling that the observer effect is an *unconscious* effect).
For example, the researchers may *expect* smokers to have a high blood pressure.

The observer effect could be managed if the researchers *first* measured the blood pressure, and *then* asked if the individual was a smoker or not.
That is, the researchers may be able to be [*blinded*](#Blinding) to whether or not the subject is a smoker when they take blood pressure measurements.
This may only be partially successful; the researcher may see the subject carrying a packet of cigarettes, or can smell smoke on their breath, for example.
Nonetheless, since it may prove at least partially successful and is easy to implement, it should form part of the study design.


::: {.example #ObsEffectObs name="Observer effect"}
In a study of animal moulting [@zimova2020using], researchers took photos of snowshoe hares, at various stages of moulting and in various environmental conditions.
Eighteen independent observers were asked to rate the moult stage from the photographs: 

> All images were randomly named and sorted, with the dates [...] removed to minimize observer expectancy bias [i.e., the observer effect]. (p. 4)
:::


::: {.example #BlindingObs name="Blinding in ecology"}
A study of research articles in ecology found:

> ... 50.4% ($n = 248$) to have potential for observer bias, but only 13.3% ($n = 33$ of $248$) of these articles stated use of blind observation. 
>
> --- @kardish2015blind

Blinding the observer is not always possible, but should be used when possible to improve the internal validity of the study.
:::


::: {.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
A study of the scats of gray wolves was used to study their diet [@SpauldingScats].
A scat analysis is where humans examine the scat of carnivores to determine the prey.
However, the accuracy of the results was questioned, due to 'perpetuation of the assumption that wolf scats contain only 1 prey item/scat' (p. 949).

The observers might be seeing what they expect to see: that "wolf scats contain only 1 prey item/scat".
:::


::: {.example name="Blinding in ecology"}
A study [@gamble2016wearing] found that bicycle riders who *wear* helmets are more likely to take risks compared to bicycle riders who *do not wear* helmets.
The bicycle riders in the study were blinded to the *purpose* of the study (which reduced the impact of the Hawthorne effect), though clearly the participants knew they were involved in a study (so the impact was not completely eliminated).
However, the study was criticised [@radun2018bicycle], since it was possible that (p. 1020)

> ... the experimenters unconsciously conveyed their expectations to participants and thereby affected their responses [...] 
> it is clear that the double-blind procedure has been developed for a reason and should have been used in this study.

The lack of [blinding](#Blinding), when it was possible to incorporate blinding, compromised the internal validity.
:::


## Comments on blinding {#BlindingObservational}

Many comments about blinding made for experimental studies (Sect. \@ref(DescribingBlinding)) apply for observational studies also. 
In observational studies, blinding individuals *may* be (but is not always) easier than in experimental studies (Sect. \@ref(HawthorneEffectObservational)).
Blinding the researchers may be difficult, since the researchers need to record the value of the explanatory variable.
To blind the researchers, sometimes two different researchers can be used: One to record the value of the response variable, and one to record the value of the explanatory variable.


::: {.example #BlindingDogs  name="Blinding in observational studies"}
In a study of dogs with chronic pancreatitis (CP), the researchers acquired abdominal ultrasounds and pathology results of each dog.
The authors report that the researchers conducting the ultrasounds were not blinded (@watson2010observational, p. 969).
However:

> Tissue samples [...] were obtained from all dogs and re-cut sections were reviewed by one of the authors (PJW) with the help of a veterinary pathologist 
> (AJR or TJS), all blinded to the clinical details of the case, but aware that CP was suspected in each dog...

This study clearly explains which parts of the study were blinded, and which were not.
:::

::: {.example #BlindingGymnasts  name="Blinding in observational studies"}
A study of Achilles tendinopathy in gymnasts [@emerson2010ultrasonographically] compared 40 elite gymnasts with 41 controls of similar non-gymnasts.
In describing the study, the authors state (p. 38):

> Although the primary investigator was blind to the clinical status of the subjects, there was no blinding to whether each subject was in the gymnast or control group during image collection [...] 
> However the examiner was blinded to both the clinical state and group of each subject when the images were reviewed. 
:::



## Recording extraneous variables {#RecordExtraneousObservational}

Recording the values of possible extraneous variables is very important for observational studies, as it one of the few ways available to manage confounding.
The reasons for recording the values of extraneous variables given in Sect. \@ref(RecordExtraneousObservational) still apply:

* To compare the sample to the population, to see if the sample is representative of the population (Sect. \@ref(Representative-samples)).
* To explain some variation in the response variable, so that the relationship between the response and explanatory variable can be isolated (Sect. \@ref(ExtraneousVariables)).
* To manage confounding:
  * To avoid lurking variables (Sect. \@ref(ExtraneousVariables)).
  * To determine if the groups being compared are similar (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding)).
  * To use the information in analysis (Sect. \@ref(ExpManagingConfoundingAnalysis)).


## Summary {#Chap8-Summary}

Designing effective *observational* studies  (Fig. \@ref(fig:DesignConsiderationsOBS)) requires researchers to maximise internal validity.
This can be achieved by *managing confounding* where possible, as confounding is often a major threat to the internal validity of observational studies.
Confounding can be managed by:

* *restricting* the study to certain groups;
* *blocking*; or
* through special *analysis* methods.

Random allocation is not possible in observational studies.
For this reason, observing, measuring, assessing or recording all the information that is likely to be important for understanding the data is important, usually to be used in analysis.
Well-designed observational studies also try to manage

* the *carry-over effect*;
* the *Hawthorne effect*;
* the *placebo effect*; and
* the *observer effect*

though the means of doing so are often not under the control of the researchers.
Recording the values of possible extraneous variables is very important for observational studies.



(ref:DesignConsiderationsOBS-Caption) Design considerations. Note: Lurking variables become confounding variables when recorded in the study, and then they can be managed. The arrows indicate the main design solution to (perhaps partially) manage the indicated potential bias. Not all solutions are possible for every study.

## Quick review questions {#Chap8-QuickReview}

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}
*Formwork* is used in construction with reinforced concrete, and can be complicated and labour intensive.
An observational study [@mine2015observational] examined the relationship between the floor area of the building (in m^2^ per storey) and the number of hours of labour needed for the construction of formwork (in person-minutes per storey).
The researchers also recorded, among other things, the average age of the workers (in years); the average years of experience of the workers (in years); and the storey height (in meters) for each of $n = 15$ multi-storey buildings in the study.

To record the labour time (p. 2):

> Two observers made the site rounds observation of 2 to 40 workers. 
> Observations were carried out continuously from the start to the end of work, excluding lunch time.

1. The *explanatory variable* is\tightlist
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	answer = "Floor area",
	"Hours of labour",
	"Average age of workers",
	"Average years of experience of workers",
	"Storey height"))} else {"________________"}`
1. The *response variable* is
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	"Floor area",
	answer = "Hours of labour",
	"Average age of workers",
	"Average years of experience of workers",
	"Storey height"))} else {"________________"}`
1. What is the *best* description for the variable 'Average age of the workers'?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	"A confounding variable, since it is likely to be related to the explanatory variable only",
	"A confounding variable, since it is likely to be related to the response variable only",
	answer = "An extraneous variable, because it is likely to be related to the response variable only",
	"A lurking variable, since we don't know how it might be related to the response and explanatory variables"))}`
1. What is the most likely way in which confounding would be managed in this study?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	"Restricting, the study to multi-storey buildings",
	"Blocking, by only studying unit blocks",
	answer = "Analysis, by using other recorded variables in the analysis",
	"Random allocation of workers to the building projects"))}`
1. True or false: The *carry-over* effect is likely to be a big problem in this study.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( FALSE)}`
1. True or false: The *Hawthorne* effect is likely to be a big problem in this study.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( TRUE)}`
1. True or false: The *placebo* effect is likely to be a big problem in this study.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( FALSE)}`
1. True or false: *Observer* bias is likely to be a big problem in this study.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( FALSE )}`

## Exercises {#DesigningObservationalExercises}

Selected answers are available in Sect. \@ref(DesigningObservationalAnswer).


::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignObsTrueFalse}
Which of the following statements are true?

1. Observational studies cannot have a control group.\tightlist
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf(answer = FALSE)}` 
2. Only experimental studies can use random allocation to avoid confounding
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf(answer = TRUE)}` 
3. Only observational studies can manage the observer effect
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf(answer = FALSE)}` 
4. Only experimental studies can use random sampling
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf(answer = FALSE)}`

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignObsPollen}
A study compared the average amount of pollen returned to the hive per bee, by two types of native Australian bees: yellow and black carpenter bees, and green carpenter bees. 
In the study, the researchers also recorded the size of the hive, among other things.  
**Why** did they do this?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( 
   c("To minimize the impact of the Hawthorne effect",
     "To ensure external validity",
     "Because the size of the hive is the explanatory variable",
     answer = "In case the size of the hive is a confounding variable") )}` 
:::


::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignTasteOfWater}
Consider this RQ (based on @teillet2010consumer): 'Among university students, is the taste of tap water different than the taste of bottled water?'

You want to answer this question using an *observational study*.
Describe what these might look like for this study:

1. Random allocation.
1. Blinding.
1. Double blinding.
1. Control.
1. Finding a random sample.

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignHawthorneEffect}
Is the Hawthorne effect only a (potential) issue in experimental studies?
Explain.
:::



::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignSleep}
A study of how well hospital patients sleep at night [@delaney2018they] had the stated aim 'to investigate the perceived duration and quality of patient sleep [...] in hospital'.
In discussing the limitations of the study, the researchers state (p. 7):
   
> The researchers made no attempt to deceive clinical staff regarding the nature of the study so the influence of the Hawthorne Effect should be considered. 
> The presence of the observer and environmental monitoring equipment in the clinical environment could have altered behaviour among patients and nursing staff 
> seeking to conform to the presumed research objectives. 
> As a result, the findings reported may be an underestimation of the magnitude of the issues that affect sleep.

Discuss these limitations in terms of the language used in this chapter.
