## Introduction {#SamplingVariationIntro}

The previous chapter introduced the decision-making process used in research:

1. Make an *assumption* about the population *parameter*.
1. Based on this assumption, describe what values the sample *statistic* might reasonably be *expected*  from all possible samples.
1. *Observe* the sample data from just one of those may possible samples.
1. *Decide* if the statistic seems *consistent* with the expectation, or if it *contradicts* the expectation.


Importantly, the sample studied is only one of countless possible samples that could have been selected.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Remember: studying a sample leads to the following observations:
\vspace{-2ex}

* Every sample is likely to be different.
* We observe just one of the many possible samples.
* Every sample is likely to yield a different value for the statistic.
* We observe just one of the many possible values for the statistic.
\vspace{-2ex}

Since many values for the statistic are possible, the values of the statistic vary (called *sampling variation*) and have a *distribution* (called a *sampling distribution*).
:::


Furthermore, under certain conditions, the variation of the *statistic* (such as the sample mean, etc.) from all possible samples can be described based on the assumption made about the parameter.
As a result, the expected behaviour of these statistics can be *described*, so we know what to *expect* from the sample *statistic* when the assumption is true.

We saw this in Sect.\ \@ref(MakingDecisionsInResearch): the sample proportion of red cards in a sample of $15$ varied from hand to hand, and was approximately distributed with a bell-shape.
This bell-shaped distribution is formally called a *normal distribution*.
This is no accident: *many statistics vary from sample to sample with an approximate normal distribution* if certain conditions are met.
We see examples in this chapter.
Bell-shaped distributions are studied further in Chap.\ \@ref(SamplingDistributions).

<!--This is called the *Central Limit Theorem*.-->

Any distribution that describes how a statistic varies for all possible samples is called a *sampling distribution*: how the value of the statistic varies from sample to sample for all possible samples.
The *sampling distribution* often has a normal distribution shape.


::: {.definition #SamplingDistribution name="Sampling distribution"}
A *sampling distribution* is the distribution of a statistic, showing how its value varies in all possible samples.

## Sample proportions have a distribution {#SamplingDistributionProportions}

Sample proportions, like all statistics, vary from sample to sample (Sect.\ \@ref(MakingDecisionsInResearch)); that is, *sampling variation* exists, so sample proportions have a *sampling distribution*.

Consider a European roulette wheel
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:RouletteWheel)):'
} else {
   'shown below in the animation:'
}`
a ball is spun and can land on any number on the wheel from $0$ to $36$ (inclusive).
Using the classical approach to probability, the probability of the ball landing on an *odd* number (an '*odd-spin*') is $p = 18/37 =  0.486$.
This is the *population proportion*.

```{r results='hide'}
source("R/RouletteWheel.R")
```
<!-- Show Roulette wheel, and some text: -->
```{r, child = if (knitr::is_html_output() ) {'./children/RouletteWheel/RouletteWheel-HTML.Rmd'}}
```


If the wheel is spun (say) $15$ times, the \emph{sample} proportion of odd-spins, denoted $\hat{p}$, will vary.
But, *how* does $\hat{p}$ vary from one set of $15$ spins to another set of $15$ spins? 
Can we describe *how* the values of $\hat{p}$ vary?

```{r RouletteWheel, fig.cap="A European roulette wheel, with numbers $0$ to $36$", echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.align="center", fig.height=3.0, fig.width=3.50}
# Wheel  
DD <- 10
dd <- 4

if (is_latex_output()){
  spin <- plotSpinningWheel( angle = deg2rad(360/37)/2, 
                             radius = dd, 
                             wheelSize = c(DD, dd),
                             plotShadow = FALSE,  
                             main = "")
}
```


```{r results='hide'}
set.seed(8723064)  # Reset seed
```


Computer simulation can be used to demonstrate what happens if the wheel was spun, over and over again, for $n = 15$ spins each time, and the proportion of odd-spins was recorded for each repetition.
The proportion of odd spins $\hat{p}$ varies from sample to sample (sampling variation), as shown by the histogram (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHist), top left panel).
The *shape* of the distribution is approximately bell shaped.
We can see that, for many repetitions, $\hat{p}$ is rarely smaller than $0.2$, and rarely larger than $0.8$.
That is, reasonable values to expect for $\hat{p}$ are between about $0.2$ and $0.8$.

If the wheel was spun (say) $n = 25$ times (rather than $15$ times), $\hat{p}$ again varies (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHist), top right panel): the values of $\hat{p}$ vary from sample to sample.
The same process can be repeated for many repetitions of (say) $n = 100$ and $n = 200$ spins (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHist), bottom panels).

Notice that as the sample size $n$ gets larger, the variation in the sampling distribution gets smaller.
With $200$ spins, for instance, observing a sample proportion smaller than $0.4$ or greater than $0.6$ seems highly unusual, but these are not uncommon at all for $15$ spins.

The sampling distributions can be described by a mean (called the *sampling mean*) and a standard deviation (called the *standard error*).

::: {.example #ReasonableValuesp name="Reasonable values for $\hat{p}$"}
Suppose we spun a roulette wheel $100$ times, and observed $31$ even numbers.
The sample proportion is $\hat{p} = 31/100 = 0.31$.
From Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHist) (bottom left panel), a sample proportion this low almost never occurs in a sample of $100$ rolls.

We observed something that is very unlikely to occur from a fair roulette wheel.
Hence, we either observed something highly unusual, or a problem exists with the wheel.

The values of the sample proportion vary from sample to sample.
The distribution of the possible values of the *sample* proportion is called a *sampling distribution*.

Under certain conditions, the sampling distribution of a sample proportion is described by an approximate a normal distribution.
In general, the approximation gets better as the sample size gets larger, and the possible values of $\hat{p}$ vary less as the sample size gets larger.

The mean of the sampling distribution is called the *sampling mean*; the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is called the *standard error*.

## Sample means have a distribution {#SamplingDistributionMeans}

The sample mean, like all statistics, varies from sample to sample (Sect.\ \@ref(MakingDecisionsInResearch)); that is, *sampling variation* exists, so sample means have a *sampling distribution*.

Consider a European roulette wheel again (Sect.\ \@ref(SamplingDistributionProportions)).
Rather than recording the sample proportion of odd-spins, suppose the *sample mean* of the numbers was recorded.
If the wheel is spun (say) $15$ times, the *sample* mean of the spins $\bar{x}$ will vary from one set of $15$ spins to another.
How does it vary?

Again, computer simulation can be used to demonstrate what could happen if the wheel was spun $15$ times, over and over again, and the mean of the numbers was recorded for each repetition.
Clearly, the sample mean spin $\bar{x}$ can vary from sample to sample (sampling variation) for $n = 15$ spins (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHistx), top left panel).

When $n = 15$, the sample mean $\bar{x}$ varies from sample to sample, and the *shape* of the distribution again is approximately bell shaped.
If the wheel was spun more than $15$ times (say, $n = 50$ times) something similar occurs (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHistx), top right panel): the values of $\bar{x}$ vary from sample to sample, and the values have an approximate bell-shaped (normal) distribution.
In fact, the values of $\bar{x}$ have a bell-shaped  distribution for other numbers of spins also (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHistx), bottom panels).

The sampling distributions can be described by a mean (called the *sampling mean*) and a standard deviation (called the *standard error*).

Suppose we spun a roulette wheel $100$ times, and the mean of the observed numbers was $\bar{x} = 18.9$.
From Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHistx) (bottom left panel), a sample mean with this value does not look unusual at all; it would occur reasonably frequently.

The evidence does not suggest a problem with the wheel.
:::


As we have seen, each sample is likely to be different, so *any* statistic is likely to be vary from sample to sample.
(The value of the *population* parameter does not change.)
This variation in the possible values of the observed sampling statistic is called *sampling variation*.



## Sampling means and standard errors {#StandardErrors}

As seen in the previous two sections, the value of a sample statistic varies from sample to sample.
Which one of the countless samples is selected determines which value of the sample statistic is observed.

The possible values of the statistics that we could potentially observe have a *distribution* (specifically, a *sampling distribution*); see Fig.\ \@ref(fig:StatisticVariesAcrossSamples).
Perhaps surprisingly, under certain conditions, the sampling distribution is often a *normal distribution*, as we have seen.

The *mean* of this sampling distribution is called the *sampling mean*.
The sampling mean is the average value of all possible values of the statistic.


::: {.definition #SamplingMean name="Sampling mean"}
The *sampling mean* is the mean of the sampling distribution of a statistic.
:::


The *standard deviation* of this sampling distribution is called the *standard error*.
The standard error measures how the value of the statistic varies across of all possible values of the statistic; see Fig.\ \@ref(fig:StatisticVariesAcrossSamples).
The standard error is a measure of how precisely the *sample* statistic estimates the *population* parameter.
If every possible sample (of a given size) was found, and the statistic computed from each sample, the standard deviation of all these estimates is the *standard error*.

Figures\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHist) and\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHistx) show that the variation in the values of the statistic get smaller for larger sample sizes.
That is, the standard error gets *smaller* as the sample sizes get *larger*: sample statistics show less variation for larger $n$.

This makes sense: *larger* samples generally produce more precise estimates.
After all, that's the advantage of using larger samples: all else being equal, larger samples are preferred as they produce more precise estimates (Sect.\ \@ref(PrecisionAccuracy)).


::: {.example #StandardErrors name="Standard errors"}
In Fig.\ \@ref(fig:RouletteWheelHistx), a sample of $250$ (i.e., $250$ spins) is unlikely to produce a sample mean larger than $20$, or smaller than $15$. 
However, in a sample of size $15$ (i.e., $15$ spins) sample means near $15$ and $20$ are quite commonplace.

In samples of size $100$, the variation in the mean spin is smaller than in samples of size $15$.
Hence, the *standard error* (the standard deviation of the sampling distributions) will be smaller for samples of size $250$ than for samples of size $15$.
:::


For many sample statistics, *the variation from sample to sample can be approximately described by a normal distribution* (the *sampling distribution*) if certain conditions are met (Sect.\ \@ref(SamplingVariationIntro)).
Furthermore, the *standard deviation of this sampling distribution is called the standard error*.
The standard error is a special name given to the *standard deviation* that describes the variation in a sample estimate that varies *from sample to sample*.


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The standard error is an unfortunate term: it is not an *error*, or even *standard*.
(For example, there is no such thing as a '*non*-standard error'.)

*standard deviation* and *standard error* [@ko2014inappropriate].
Understanding the difference is important.

The *standard deviation*, in general, quantifies the amount of variation in any quantity that varies.
The *standard error* specifically refers to the standard deviation that describes a sampling distribution.

Typically, *standard deviations* describe the variation in the individuals in a sample: how observations vary from *individual to individual*.
The *standard error* is only used to describe how *sample estimates* vary from sample to sample (i.e., to describe the precision of sample estimates).

The standard error *is* a standard deviation, but is only used to describe the variation in sampling distributions.
*Any* numerical quantity estimated from a sample (a *statistic*) can vary from sample to sample, and so has sampling variation, a sampling distribution, and hence a standard error.
(Not all sampling distributions are *normal* distributions, however.)

*Any* quantity estimated from a sample (a statistic) has a standard error. 
:::


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The *standard error* is often abbreviated to 'SE' or 's.e.'.
For example, the 'standard error of the sample mean' is often written $\text{s.e.}(\bar{x})$, and the 'standard error of the sample proportion' is often written $\text{s.e.}(\hat{p})$.

## Chapter summary {#SamplingVariationSummary}

A *sampling distribution* describes how all possible values of a statistic vary from sample to sample.
Under certain circumstances, the sampling distribution often can be described by a *normal distribution*.
The standard deviation of this normal distribution is called a *standard error*.
The standard error is the name specifically given to the standard deviation that describes the variation in the statistic *across all possible samples*.
