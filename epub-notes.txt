I had trouble creating the epub file.

Some notes:

* I removed the  `allowfullscreen` option from all youtube links
* I had to do some fancy footwork with tables, as the `kableExtra` packages didn't work with epub (`kable_styling`; `row_spec`; `column_spec`, etc.).
  This means some tables in the `epub` version will look very odd until I get around to fixing them for the `epub` format explicitly.
* The  `webex` questions do not get flagged as correct (green) or incorrect (red)
* Some images and icons look awkward

The `epub` book viewed in Books on my mac look pretty good.

But all of the `epub` viewers I used on Windows made the book look very clumsy and clunky.
