## Introduction {#Chap15-Intro}

This chapter briefly discusses *probability*.
*Probability* quantifies the chance that a specific, unknown result (an 'event') from some random procedure will happen in the future.
Probabilities are similar to proportions, but probabilities concern unknown future events.
Before discussing probability, some associated terms needs defining.


## Random procedures, sample spaces and simple events {#SampleSpaceEvents}

To talk about probability, *random procedures* must be defined first.


::: {.definition #RandomProcedure name="Random procedure"}
A *random procedure* is a sequence of well-defined steps that (a)\ can be repeated, in theory, indefinitely under essentially identical conditions; (b)\ has well-defined results; and (c)\ has result that are unpredictable from any individual repetition.
:::

Using this definition, the result of rolling a die is a 'random procedure', with outcomes 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{1}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9856;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{2}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9857;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{3}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9858;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{5}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9860;</span>'
}`
and
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{6}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9861;</span>'
}`.


A list of all distinct possible results from one instance of a random procedure is the *sample space*.
A *simple event* is any element of the sample space.


::: {.definition #SampleSpace name="Sample space"}
The *sample space* is a list of all possible and distinct results after administering a random procedure once. 
:::


::: {.definition #SimpleEvent name="Simple event"}
A *simple event* is a single element of the sample space. 
:::

</div>


::: {.example #SampleSpaceDie name="Sample spaces"}
Consider rolling a fair, six-sided die (the random procedure).
We do not know what face will be uppermost until we roll the die.

However, the *sample space* for this procedure can be listed: 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{1}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9856;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{2}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9857;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{3}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9858;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{5}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9860;</span>'
}`
and
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{6}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9861;</span>'
}`.
These are all distinct results (no overlap), and the sample space is *discrete*.

The event 'rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{1}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9856;</span>'
}`'
is a simple event.
:::


Combinations of the elements in the sample space are usually of interest.
These are called *compound events*.


::: {.definition #CompoundEvent name="Compound event"}
A *compound event* is any combination of simple events (i.e., of elements in the sample space).
:::


::: {.example #Events name="Events"}
Many *events* can be defined using the sample space in Example\ \@ref(exm:SampleSpaceDie), including:

* Rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`: 
  This *simple event* includes one element of the sample space:
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`.
* Rolling a even number: 
  This *compound event* includes three elements of the sample space: 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{2}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9857;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}` and
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{6}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9861;</span>'
}`.
* Rolling a number larger than 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{2}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9857;</span>'
}`: 
  This *compound event* includes four elements of the sample space: 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{3}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9858;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{5}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9860;</span>'
}` and
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{6}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9861;</span>'
}`.
:::


::: {.example #SampleSpaceThrowing name="Sample spaces and events"}
Consider the distance you can throw a baseball (the random procedure).
We do not know beforehand what distance your next throw will be, but the *sample space* (the throwing distance) is a number greater than $0$\ m (and some of those distances are *very* unlikely to occur...).
This sample space is *continuous*.

Many *compound events* can be defined using this sample space; for example:

* throwing more than $50$\ m.
* throwing between $10$ and $40$\ m.

Because the sample space is continuous, throwing an *exact* distance (such as *exactly* $10$\ m) is technically not possible.
:::


Events of interest are often related to other events, using **and**, **or**, **not**.
Consider two events called\ $A$ and\ $B$.
Then, '$A$ **and**\ $B$' is the event comprising events in $A$ and also in $B$.
'$A$ **or**\ $B$' is the event comprising events in $A$,events in $B$, or events in both.
The event '**not** $A$' comprises all the events in the sample space that are *not* in Event\ $A$.


::: {.example #ComplicatedEvents name="Complicated events"}
Consider rolling a fair, six-sided die again (Example\ \@ref(exm:SampleSpaceDie)).
Suppose we define these two (compound) events:

* Event $A$: Roll a number divisible by\ $2$.
* Event $B$: Roll a number divisible by\ $3$.

Event $A$ comprises the simple events 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{2}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9857;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}` and
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{6}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9861;</span>'

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{3}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9858;</span>'
}` and
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{6}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9861;</span>'
}`.

Then, the event '$A$ **and** $B$' includes all events in $A$ and *also* in $B$; that is, '$A$ **and** $B$' comprises the single simple event
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{6}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9861;</span>'
}`.

Event '$A$ **or** $B$' include the events in $A$, the events in $B$, and those in both; that is, '$A$ **or** $B$' comprises the four simple events 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{2}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9857;</span>'
}`,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {

}` and
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{6}'
} else {

The event '**not**\ $A$' comprises the three simple events

## Probability {#ProbabilityDefined}
\index{Probability}

Using these definitions, a *probability* can be defined.


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-coin-5-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #Probability name="Probability"}
A *probability* is a number between $0$ and $1$ inclusive (or between $0$% and $100$% inclusive) that quantifies the likelihood that a certain *event* will occur.
:::


A probability of $0$ (or $0$%) means the event is 'impossible' (will *never* occur), and a probability of $1$ (or $100$%) means that the event is *certain* to happen (will *always* occur).
Most events have a probability between the extremes of $0$% and $100$%.


::: {.example #Probabilities name="Probabilities"}
Consider these cases:

* The probability of receiving negative rainfall is\ $0$; it is impossible.
* The probability of receiving some rain in London next year is\ $1$; it is certain.
* The probability of receiving rain on a future day in London is between\ $0$ and\ $1$ inclusive.
:::


The probability of an event occurring can be computed in different ways, including:

* the *classical approach* (Sect.\ \@ref(ProbClassical));
* the *relative frequency approach* (Sect.\ \@ref(ProbRelFreq)); and
* the *subjective approach* (Sect.\ \@ref(ProbSubjective)).
   
   
## Classical approach {#ProbClassical}
\index{Probability!classical approach}

What is the probability of rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`
on a die?
The sample space has six possible outcomes (see Example\ \@ref(exm:SampleSpaceDie)) that are *equally likely* to occur, and the event 'rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   "\\Largedice{4}'"
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>\''
}`
comprises just *one* of those.
Thus,  
\[
   \text{Probability of rolling a $\Largedice{4}$}
   = \frac{\text{The number of results that are a $\Largedice{4}$}}{\text{The number of possible results}} 
   = \frac{1}{6}.
\]
This approach to computing probabilities is called the  *classical* approach to probability, and is only appropriate when all events in the sample space are *equally likely*.


::: {.definition #ClassicalApproachToProbability name="Classical approach to probability"}
In the *classical approach to probability*, the probability of an event occurring is the number of elements of the sample space included in the event, divided by the total number of elements in the sample space, *when all outcomes are equally likely*.
:::

By this definition:  
\[
   \text{Prob. of an event}
    = 
    \frac{\text{Number of equally-likely results in the event of interest}}{\text{Total number of equally-likely results}}.
\]


::: {.example #SimpleProb name="Complicated probabilities"}
Consider rolling a standard six-sided die.
With six equally-likely results (Example\ \@ref(exm:SampleSpaceDie)), each with probability $1/6$ (or, approximately, $16.67$%) of occurring, the probability of rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`
is $1/6$.
:::


We can say that 'the probability of rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`
is $1/6$', or 'the probability of rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`
is (approximately) $0.1667$'.
The answer can also be expressed as a *percentage*: 'the probability of rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`
is (approximately) $16.67$%'.\index{Percentages}
The answer could also be interpreted as 'the *expected* proportion of rolls that are a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`
is (approximately) $0.1667$'.\index{Proportions}
That is, about $16.67$% of a very large number of future rolls are likely to be a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`.

The chance of rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`
in the future is $0.1667$, but any single roll of the die either *will* or *will not* produce a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{4}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9859;</span>'
}`... and we don't know which will occur.


::: {.example #ProbabilityOutcomes name="Describing probability"}
Consider rolling a standard six-sided die.

* The *probability* of rolling an even number is $3 \div 6 = 0.5$.
* The *percentage* of rolls  expected to be even is $3 \div 6 \times 100 = 50$%.
* The *odds* of rolling an even number is $3\div 3 = 1$.
:::


::: {.example #SimpleProb2 name="Simple probabilities"}
Consider rolling a standard six-sided die.
There are six equally-likely results (Example\ \@ref(exm:SampleSpaceDie)) each with probability $1/6$ (or approxmiately $16.67$%) of occurring.
The probability of rolling a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{1}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9856;</span>'
}`
**or** a 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\Largedice{2}'
} else {
   '<span class="larger-die">&#9857;</span>'
}`
is $2/6$ (or approximately $33.33$%).
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
*Probabilities* describe the likelihood that an event will occur *before* the result is known.
*Odds* and *proportions* can be used either *before* or *after* the result is known, provided the wording is correct.

For example, *proportions* describe how often an event has occurred *after* the result is known, and *expected proportions* describe the likelihood that an event will occur *before* the result is known.
:::


The following example may help explain.

::: {.example #ProbProportioOdds name="Probabilities, proportions and odds"}
*Before* a fair coin is tossed:\index{Probability}\index{Proportions}\index{Odds}
  
* The *probability* of throwing a head in the future is $1/2 = 0.5$ (or $50$%).
* The *expected proportion* of heads for many future coin tosses is $0.5$.
* The *odds* of throwing a head in the future is $1/1 = 1$.

If we have *already* tossed a coin $100$ times and found $47$ heads:
  
* The *proportion* of heads in the sample is $47/100 = 0.47$.
* The odds that we *threw* a head in the sample is $47/53 = 0.887$.

The 'probability that we just threw a head' makes no sense, because the event has already occurred.
:::
   


## Relative frequency approach {#ProbRelFreq}
\index{Probability!relative frequency approach}


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/father-22194_640.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


What is the probability that a new-born baby will be a boy?
The sample space could be listed as: *boy* and *non-boy*.
Since the sample space has two elements, the classical approach suggests the probability is $1\div2 =  0.5$.
However, this approach is appropriate *only if* boys and non-boys are *equally likely* to be born.
But are they?


In 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Australia'
} else {
   '[Australia](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mothers-babies/australias-mothers-babies/data)'
}`
in 2021, $289\ 603$ live births occurred, with $148\ 636$ male births, $140\ 944$ female births, and $23$ others (or 'not stated').
The *proportion* of boys born in 2021 is $148\ 636\div 289\ 603 = 0.513$, or about $51.3$%.
An *estimate* of the probability that the next birth will be a boy is about $0.513$ (or $51.3$%).
This is the *relative frequency* approach to calculating probabilities: using past data.

Using the relative frequency method can only ever produce an *approximate* probability, as it is based on a limited number of past observations.
An actual probability would require an infinite number of observations. 


::: {.definition #RelativeFrequencyApproachToProbability name="Relative frequency approach to probability"}
In the *relative frequency approach to probability*, the probability of an event is approximately the number of times the outcomes of interest has appeared in the past, divided by the number of 'attempts' in the past.
This produces an *approximate* probability.
:::


::: {.example #RFProbability name="Relative frequency probability"}
Based on the earlier information, the *odds* that a new baby will be a boy is *approximately* $0.513\div (1 - 0.513) = 1.053$.\index{Odds}
According to the 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS):'
} else {
   '[Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](http:www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/B8865D71D84F5210CA2579330016754C?opendocument):'
}`

> The sex ratio for all births registered in Australia generally fluctuates around $105.5$ male births per $100$ female births.

This is close to the odds of $1.053$ found above.

## Subjective approach {#ProbSubjective}
\index{Probability!subjective approach}


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/cyclone-62957_640.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


Many probabilities cannot be computed using the classical or relative frequency approach; for example, what is the probability that California will experience a Category\ 1 cyclone next year?
In this case, only a *subjective probability* can be given.

'Subjective' probabilities may be based on personal judgement or experience, such as the chance that your favourite sporting team wins on the weekend.
They can also be given by considering all the relevant issues that may impact the probability (and may, for example, be based on mathematical models that incorporate information from numerous inputs).
Depending on how these other issues are considered and combined, different subjective probabilities may be given.

Weather forecasts are one example: they incorporate data from sea surface temperatures, local topography, air pressures, air temperatures and so on.
Different models use different inputs, and may combine these inputs differently to produce different (subjective) forecast probabilities.


::: {.definition #SubjectiveApproachToProbability name="Subjective approach to probability"}
In the *subjective approach to probability*, various factors are incorporated, perhaps subjectively, to determine the probability of an event occurring.
:::


::: {.example #SubjectiveProbElNino name="Subjective probability"}
During El `r readr::parse_character( c("Niño"), locale = locale(encoding = "UTF-8"))` events, eastern Australia typically experiences drier-than-average winters and springs.
The 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   "Australian Broadcasting Corporation's news website"
} else {
  "[Australian Broadcasting Corporation's news website](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-23/noaa-bom-el-nino-chances-explored/102341466)"
}`
reported (on 23\ May, 2023) that the Australian *Bureau of Meteorology* predicted a $50$% probability of an El `r readr::parse_character( c("Niño"), locale=locale(encoding="UTF-8"))` event in 2023, while the American *National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration* predicted a $90$% chance of an El `r readr::parse_character( c("Niño"), locale=locale(encoding="UTF-8"))` event in 2023.

Despite this, '[both] agencies are looking at the same part of the Pacific Ocean' to make their predictions.
However, 'the US and Australia base their probability on different criteria'.
The probabilities are subjective probabilities.

## Independence {#Independence}
\index{Independence}

One important concept in probability is *independence*.
Two events are *independent* if the probability of one event happening is the same, whether or not the other event has happened.
For example, if you toss a coin, the probability of getting a head is the same whether you are sitting or standing.
That is, the result of a coin toss is *independent* of your position.

::: {.definition #Independence name="Independence"}
Two events are *independent* if the probability of one event is the same, whether or not the other event has happened.
:::


::: {.example #IndependenceCards name="Independence"}
Consider drawing two cards from a fair pack (of $52$ cards), *without* returning the first card.
For the *first* card, the sample space contains every card in the pack, and drawing any one card is as equally likely as drawing any other.
Since four cards are **Aces**, the probability of drawing an **Ace** on the first draw is $4/52$ (using the classical approach).

If we drew an **Ace** for the first card, the probability of drawing an **Ace** for the *second* card is $3/51$ (*three* **Aces** remain among the $51$ remaining cards).
Alternatively, if we *don't* draw an **Ace** for the first card, the probability of drawing an **Ace** second time is $4/51$ (*four* **Aces** remain among the $51$ remaining cards).

That is, the probability of drawing an **Ace** for the second card *depends* on whether or not an **Ace** was drawn for the first card.
The two events 'Drawing an **Ace** for the first card' and 'Drawing an **Ace** for the second card' are *not independent* events.
:::



::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
A 'standard' pack of cards has $52$ cards, organised into four *suits*: spades $\spadesuit$, clubs $\clubsuit$ (both black), 
hearts $\heartsuit$ and diamonds $\diamondsuit$ (both red).
Each *suit* has $13$ *denominations*: $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, $9$, $10$, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), Ace (A).
The Ace, King, Queen and Jack are called *picture cards*.
(Most packs also contain two jokers, which are not considered part of a *standard* pack.)

:::{.example #Sunglasses name="Wearing sunglasses"}
@data:Dexter2019:SunProtection recorded the number of people at the foot of the Goodwill Bridge,  Brisbane, who wore sunglasses between $11$:$30$am to $12$:$30$pm (Table\ \@ref(tab:SunglassesTableProb)).
Is the wearing of sunglasses *independent* of the person's gender?

If this was true, the probability of a female wearing sunglasses would be equal to the probability of a male wearing sunglasses.
From Table\ \@ref(tab:SunglassesTableProb):

* The probability of a female wearing sunglasses: $126\div 366 = 0.344$, and
* The probability of a   male wearing sunglasses: $123\div 386 = 0.319$.

These probabilities are close, but not exactly equal.

## Chapter summary {#ToolsProbability-Summary}

Three ways to compute probabilities are:

* the *classical approach*, which requires all outcomes to be *equally likely*;
* the *relative frequency* approach (giving approximate probabilities); and 
* the *subjective approach*.

Two events are *independent* if the probability of one event is the same, whether or not other event has happened.

::: {.exercise #SensitivitySpecifity}

In disease testing, two keys aspects of the test are:

* *Sensitivity*: the probability of a *positive* test result among those *with* the disease; and
* *Specificity*: the probability of a *negative* test result among those *without* the disease.

Both are important for understanding how well a test works in practice.

A certain test has a *sensitivity* of $0.99$ and a *specificity* of $0.98$.
Consider a group of $1000$ people, $100$ of whom (unknowingly) have the disease and $900$ who (unknowingly) do not have the disease.
All the people are given the test.

1. Suppose the $100$ people who *do* have a disease are tested. 
   How many would be expected to return a positive test result?
1. Suppose the $900$ people who *do not* have a disease are tested. 
   How many would be expected to return a positive test result?
1. In total, how many positive tests would be expected from the $1000$ people? 
1. Consider those people who return a positive test result.
   What is the probability that one of these people actually has the disease?

On October\ 13, the American television programme *Nightline* interviewed Dr Richard Andrews, director of the California Office of Emergency Services, to discussed various natural disasters that were being predicted.
In the interview, Dr Andrews said:

Explain why Dr Andrews is incorrect when he says that 'every probability is $50$--$50$'. 
Give an example to show why he must be incorrect.
