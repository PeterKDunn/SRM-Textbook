## Ethical guidelines {#EthicalGuidelines}

All research *must* be ethical, and *must* meet ethical guidelines.
Every university and research organisation in the world is committed to promoting and enforcing responsible research practices (RRPs) regarding people, animals, the environment and procedures.
Studies **must** be ethical, to minimise risk of harm to the environment and to participants, and to preserve the well-being, dignity, rights and safety of participants (including animals).

Most research studies require a comprehensive ethics approval process before research begins, which must be approved by an ethics committee.
We only give brief comments about research ethics; some are obvious and are common-sense.

::: {.example name="Ethics"}
Ethics are important for *all* studies, not just those involving people or animals.
For example:
  
* An study in *engineering* [@rubbo2019retractions] found 238 engineering articles published between 1945 and 2015 were retracted; the most common reason was unethical research practice. 
* A study of 807 researchers in *ecology* [@fraser2018questionable] found very high rates of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs) by researchers, often above 50% for some types of QRPs. 
  These rates were similar to the rates of QRPs in *psychology*.

* @coudert2019correcting documents 331 retractions in the *chemical sciences* in 2017 and 2018 due to QRPs, such as falsification of data and plagiarism.

* @schwitzgebel2009ethicists found that ethicists (those who study ethics) were more likely to steal library books than other philosophers.

## Common ethical issues {#Common-Ethical-Issues}

<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/mikael-seegen-jX6WXNkvsPs-unsplash.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


Common ethical issues (most of which are evaluated by *Ethics Committees*) include:
    
* **Physical risks**:
  Physical harm or discomfort should be avoided or minimised.
* **Psychological risks**: 
  Psychological harm or discomfort should be avoided or minimised.
* **Social risks**: 
  Social harm or discomfort should be avoided or minimised.
* **Environmental risks**: 
  Environmental impacts and damage should be avoided or minimised.
* **Economic risks**: 
  Financial loss to participants should be avoided. 
  Reimbursements of reasonable costs for participating may need to be considered.
* **Incentives to participate**: 
  If participants are offered incentives to participate (above reimbursement of costs), these should be acknowledged as it may (perhaps unconsciously) cause participants to influence the results.
* **Legal risks**: 
  Participants should not be put in the position of breaking any laws.
* **Acknowledgement**: 
  All those who contributed to the research should be acknowledged. 
  This includes those who make figures or have taken photographs, or have helped with data collection.
* **Confidentiality**: 
  Data should be kept secure and confidential.
* **Resourcing**: 
  The study should not waste resources, time or money (e.g, if the answer to the RQ is already known, the study is not necessary).
* **Storage of data**: 
  Data should be stored securely.
* **Consent**: 
  People should consent to being in the study (if appropriate), and hence should be told what the study involves.
  People should also be able to withdraw from the study without penalty.
* **Plagiarism**: 
  The work of others should be appropriately acknowledged and not claimed to be original (Sect. \@ref(Plagiarism)).
* **Analysis**:
  The analysis must be approached ethically, and using the appropriate methods.


::: {.example #EthicsTuskegee name="Poor ethics"}
In the Tuskegee syphilis experiment [@corbie1999continuing], conducted between 1932 and 1972, treatments were actively withheld from men with syphilis.
The men's wives and children often were affected.

The men were lied to about the treatment they were given, and were prevented from seeking treatment elsewhere.
This was a highly unethical study, and could never be conducted now.
:::
      

::: {.example #EthicsChallenger name="Poor ethics in analysis"}
In 1986, the American space shuttle *Challenger* exploded just after launch, killing all seven astronauts on board.
A review of the disaster [@data:dalal:shuttle] found that the cause was partly that the engineers dismissed some data that they should have used.
This was unethical scientific practice.

## Academic integrity 

**Academic integrity** refers to conducting research ethically, honestly and responsibly.
The opposite of academic integrity is *academic misconduct*.
You should read your university's information about academic integrity and academic misconduct, including the information about the *consequences* of academic misconduct.

In the context of research, academic integrity covers areas such as collusion, fraud and plagiarism  (discussed in Sect. \@ref(Plagiarism)).


* **Collusion**:
  *Collusion* occurs when people work together to produce work, but not all receive the credit.
  In a research context, *collusion*  means failing to acknowledge the contributions and ideas of others.

* **Fraud**:
  *Fraud* refers to the intent to deceive.
  This may happen by falsifying or inventing data, forgery, fabricating experiments or information.


::: {.example #EthicsSarkar name="Fraud"}
Microbiologist Keka Sarkar had articles retracted due to fraud, including self-plagiarism and reusing figures that were claimed to be from different studies (@Chatterjee2015, p. 1527).

### Reproducible research {#ReproducibleResearch}

One way to ensure that the results of research are reliable and trustworthy is to encourage *reproducible* research: enabling someone else to repeat the study and analysis.
For research to be reproducible, the protocol, data, analysis methods and any relevant computer code must be made available [@laine2007reproducible].

Methods for ensuring reproducible research is discipline dependent, and beyond the scope of this book.
However, realising the *need* for reproducibility is important; for example, it emphasises the importance of describing the protocol.
Different journals also have different expectations regarding reproducibility.

Many researchers strongly advise *against* using point-and-click interfaces (e.g., Excel) for analysis since the results are not reproducible:

> ... traditional means of data management, such as storing and manipulating data using spreadsheets, are no longer adequate [...], and new approaches are required for analyzing data.
>
> --- @lewis2018wildlife, p. 172

The importance of reproducibility in the analysis phase is crucial:

> There are serious medical consequences to errors attributable to the effects of spreadsheet programs and software operated through a graphical user interface [...] 
> The opacity of graphical user interfaceâ€“based statistical analysis and the importance of research transparency and reproducibility have been high-lighted by scientific scandals that could have been avoided through a reproducible research paradigm...
> 
> --- @simons2019reproducible, p. 471


Rather than using spreadsheets (which have significant problems when used for analysis; Sect. \@ref(DataEntry)), using tools which encourage reproducible research are recommended.
Statistical software packages, such as R (on which jamovi is based), are recommended.


::: {.example #Paramedicine name="Unethical reporting and practice"}
A 'Letter to the Editor' of paramedic journal [@George2015] questioned an article [@Hosseini2015] in which researchers claimed to have *randomly* allocated participants into two groups.
The Letter noted that the initial average weights of the participants in each group were significantly different:

> It is extraordinarily unlikely that any variable would be that different between two groups if allocation was truly random. 
> Even it was truly random, the stated method of "the samples were randomly divided into two groups"... does not describe the "method used to generate the random allocation sequence"...
>

## Exercises {#EthicsExercises}

::: {.exercise #EthicsCougars}
Consider this (real) conundrum facing researchers [@crozier2015towards]:

> A research team has an extraordinarily successful long-term study of a population of bighorn sheep (*Ovis canadensis*) on Ram Mountain [...]
\smallskip
>
> The population contains marked individuals for which the research team has incredibly detailed data on phenotype, pedigree, and life-history. 
> Many graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and senior scientists have studied this population, and this research has lead to numerous important publications.
\smallskip
>
> Recently, however, a cougar (*Puma concolor*) that has learned to specialize on these sheep is slowly but surely eating all of them. 
> This is a study of a natural population, which includes predation, but this cougar is drastically reducing the sample size of the study. 
\smallskip
>
> Since it is legal to hunt cougars in the region where this study is taking place, one option is to try to kill the predator; 
> however, even if a cougar were successfully hunted, this would not ensure that it was the correct one.

What action would you recommend? 
Explain your reasoning, including from an ethical point-of-view.

::: {.exercise #EthicsSideEffects}
Suppose a very deadly and highly contagious disease breaks out.
Is it ethical to begin the use of a new drug to treat those affected, even though the drug is still experimental and the potentially harmful side effects are unknown?
Discuss your point-of-view.
:::


::: {.exercise #EthicsLying}
Is it ethical to lie to the subjects in a study?
*Deception* is used in some disciplines, and may be approved by ethics committees under certain circumstances (such as the potential benefits of the study, and whether the deception is likely to cause physical or psychological discomfort to the participants).

Do you think it is ethical to tell participants that they are taking an active medication, when it is actually ineffective (a 'placebo') [@data:Waber2008:Placebo]?
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages, including what we can learn from such a study that may be beneficial.
