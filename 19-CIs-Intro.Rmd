# (PART) Analysis: Confidence intervals {-}



# Introducing confidence intervals {#CIIntro}

One type of
[research question](#TwoApproaches)
is the
[estimation-type RQ](#TwoApproachesCI),
when the precision of a *statistic* is of interest.
In this Part,
answering estimation-type RQs is discussed for:

* Descriptive RQs:
  Chaps.&nbsp;\@ref(CIOneProportion) to \@ref(PairedCI);
* Relational or interventional RQs with a *comparison*:
  Chaps.&nbsp;\@ref(CITwoMeans) and \@ref(OddsRatiosCI).

Answering estimation-type RQs for relational or interventional RQs with a 
*connection* is explored later
(Chaps.&nbsp;\@ref(Correlation) and \@ref(Regression)).

The precision of statistics influences
[decision-type RQ](#TwoApproachesHT) too:
when [statistics](#StatisticsAndParameters) precisely estimate [parameters](#StatisticsAndParameters),
making decisions about parameters is easier.

The previous chapters,
where tools for describing sampling variation were introduced,
are used in this part to understand the precision of statistics.
