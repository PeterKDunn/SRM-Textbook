## Introduction {#Chap16-Intro}

This chapter briefly discusses *probability*.
*Probability* quantifies the chance that a particular result from some procedure (an 'event') will happen in the future.
A list of all possible results from this procedure is called the *sample space*.
An *event* is any combination of these elements of the sample space.


::: {.definition #SampleSpace name="Sample space"}
The *sample space* is a list of all possible and distinct results after administering a procedure whose result is unknown beforehand. 
:::


::: {.definition #Event name="Event"}
An *event* is any combination of the elements in the sample space.

::: {.example #SampleSpaceDie name="Sample spaces and events"}
Consider rolling a fair, six-sided die.
We do not know what face will be uppermost until we roll the die.

However, the *sample space* for this procedure can be listed: `r include_graphics("Dice/die1.png", dpi=1250)`, `r include_graphics("Dice/die2.png", dpi=1250)`, `r include_graphics("Dice/die3.png", dpi=1250)`, `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)`, `r include_graphics("Dice/die5.png", dpi=1250)` and `r include_graphics("Dice/die6.png", dpi=1250)`.
These are all distinct results (no overlap), and the sample space is [*discrete*](#def:DiscreteData).

Many *events* can be defined using this sample space; for example:

* Rolling a `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)`: 
  This event includes one element of the sample space: `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)`.

* Rolling a even number: 
  This event includes three elements of the sample space: `r include_graphics("Dice/die2.png", dpi=1250)`, `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)` and `r include_graphics("Dice/die6.png", dpi=1250)`

* Rolling a number larger than `r include_graphics("Dice/die2.png", dpi=1250)`: 
  This event includes four elements of the sample space:   `r include_graphics("Dice/die3.png", dpi=1250)`, `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)`, `r include_graphics("Dice/die5.png", dpi=1250)` and `r include_graphics("Dice/die6.png", dpi=1250)`.
:::


::: {.example #SampleSpaceThrowing name="Sample spaces and events"}
Consider the distance you can throw a baseball.
We do not know beforehand what distance your next throw will be, but we can describe the *sample space* for this procedure:
the distance could be anywhere between (say) 0 and 200 metres (and of course, some of those distances are very unlikely to occur...).
This sample space is [*continuous*](#def:ContinuousData).

Many *events* can be defined using this sample space; for example:

* Throwing more than 50 metres: 
  This event includes elements of the sample space greater than 50m.
* Throwing between 10 and 40 metres: 
  This event includes elements of the sample space between 10m and 40m.
* Throwing less than 20 metres: 
  This event includes elements of the sample space less than 20m.

Because the sample space is continuous, throwing an *exact* distance (such as *exactly* 10 metres) is technically not possible.
:::


Once a sample space is defined, a *probability* can be defined.


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">

</div>


::: {.definition #Probability name="Probability"}
A *probability* is a number between 0 and 1 inclusive (or between 0% and 100% inclusive) that quantifies the likelihood that a certain *event* will occur.
:::


A probability of zero (or 0%) means the event is 'impossible' (will *never* occur), and a probability of one (or 100%) means that the event is *certain* to happen (will always occur).
Most events have a probability between the extremes of 0% and 100%.


::: {.example #Probabilities name="Probabilities"}
Consider these cases:

* The probability of receiving negative rainfall is zero.
  It is impossible.
* The probability of receiving some rain in Sydney in the next decade is one.
  It is certain.
* The probability of receiving rain on any given day in Sydney is between 0 and 1 inclusive.
:::


The probability of an event occurring can be computed in different ways, including:

* the *classical approach* (Sect. \@ref(ProbClassical));
* the *relative frequency approach* (Sect. \@ref(ProbRelFreq)); and
* the *subjective approach* (Sect. \@ref(ProbSubjective)).


## Classical approach {#ProbClassical}

What is the probability of rolling a `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)` on a die?
The sample space has six possible outcomes (see Example \@ref(exm:SampleSpaceDie)) that are *equally likely*, and the event ('rolling a `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)`') comprises just *one* of those.
Thus,

\[
   \text{Prob. of rolling a four}
   = \frac{\text{The number of results that are a 4}}{\text{The number of possible results}}
   = \frac{1}{6}.
\]
This approach to computing probabilities is called the  *classical* approach to probability, and is only appropriate when all events in the sample space are *equally likely*.

We say that 'the probability of rolling a `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)` is 1/6', or 'the probability of rolling a `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)` is 0.1667'.
The answer can also be expressed as a *percentage* ('the probability of rolling a `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)` is 16.7%').
The answer could also be interpreted as 'the *expected* proportion of rolls that are a `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)` is 0.167'.

The chance of rolling a `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)` in the future is 0.1667, but a roll of the die either will or will not produce a `r include_graphics("Dice/die4.png", dpi=1250)`... and we don't know which will occur.


::: {.example #ProbabilityOutcomes name="Describing probability outcomes"}
Consider rolling a standard six-sided die.

* The *probability* of rolling an even number is $3 \div 6 = 0.5$.
* The *percentage* of rolls that are expected to be even numbers is $3 \div 6 \times 100 = 50$%.
* The *odds* of rolling an even number is $3\div 3 = 1$.
:::


::: {.definition #ClassicalApproachToProbability name="Classical approach to probability"}
In the *classical approach to probability*, the probability of an event occurring is the number of elements of the sample space included in the event, divided by the total number of elements in the sample space, *when all outcomes are equally likely*.
:::

By this definition:

\[
   \text{Prob. of an event}
    = 
    \frac{\text{Number of equally-likely outcomes in the event of interest}}{\text{Total number of equally-likely outcomes}}
\]


::: {.example #ComplicatedEvents name="More complicated events"}
Consider rolling a standard six-sided die.
There are six equally likely outcomes (Example \@ref(exm:SampleSpaceDie)) each with probability $1/6$ (or 16.7%) of occurring.
The probability of rolling a `r include_graphics("Dice/die1.png", dpi=1250)`  *or* a `r include_graphics("Dice/die2.png", dpi=1250)` is $2/6$ (or 33.3%).
:::
   

::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
*Probabilities* describe the likelihood that an event will occur *before* the outcome is known.
*Odds* and *proportions* can be used either *before* or *after* the outcome is known, provided the wording is correct.
For example:

* *Proportions* describe how often an event has occurred *after* the outcome is known.
* *Expected proportions* describe the likelihood that an event will occur *before* the outcome is known.
:::


The following example may help explain.

::: {.example #ProbProportioOdds name="Probabilities, proportions and odds"}
*Before* a fair coin is tossed:
  
* The *probability* of throwing a head is $1/2 = 0.5$.
* The *expected proportion* of heads in many coin tosses is 0.5.
* The *odds* of throwing a head is $1/1 = 1$.

If we have already tossed a coin 100 times and found 47 heads:
  
* The *proportion* of heads in the sample is $47/100 = 0.47$.
* The odds that we *threw* a head in the sample is $47/53 = 0.887$.

The 'probability that we just threw a head' makes no sense, because the event has already occurred.
:::
   


## Relative frequency approach {#ProbRelFreq}

What is the probability that a new-born baby will be a boy?
The sample space could be listed as: *boy* and *non-boy*.
The classical approach could be used, since the sample space has two elements:  $1\div2 =  0.5$.
This approach is fine *only if* boys and non-boys are *equally likely* to be born.
But are they?

In 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Australia in 2015,'
} else {
   '[Australia in 2015](http:www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/B8865D71D84F5210CA2579330016754C?opendocument),'
}`
305,377 live births occurred, with 157,088 male births and 148,289 non-male births.
The *proportion* of boys born in 2015 is $157\,088\div 305\,377 = 0.514$, or about 51.4%.
An *estimate* of the probability that the next birth will be a boy is about 0.514 (or 51.4%).
This is the *relative frequency* approach to calculating probabilities: based on past data.

The probability that the next birth will be a boy is *approximately* 0.514, but the next birth either will or will not be a boy... and we don't know which will occur.


::: {.definition #RelativeFrequencyApproachToProbability name="Relative frequency approach to probability"}
In the *relative frequency approach to probability*, the probability of an event is (approximately) the number of times the outcomes of interest has appeared in the past, divided by the number of 'attempts' in the past.
:::


::: {.example #RFProbability name="Relative frequency probability"}
Based on this information, the *odds* that a new baby will be a boy is *approximately* $0.514\div (1 - 0.514) = 1.058$.
According to the 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS):'
} else {
   '[Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](http:www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/B8865D71D84F5210CA2579330016754C?opendocument):'
}`

> The sex ratio for all births registered in Australia generally fluctuates around 105.5 male births per 100 female births.

This is close to the odds of 1.058 found above.

Many probabilities cannot be computed using the classical or relative frequency approach; for example, What is the probability that California will experience a Category 1 cyclone next year?
In this case, only a *subjective probability* can be given.

'Subjective' probabilities may sound like they are 'made up', but it actually means the probability is estimated by considering all the relevant issues that may impact the probability (and may, for example, be based on mathematical models that incorporate information from numerous inputs).
Depending on how these other issues are considered and combined, different individuals may give different subjective probabilities.

Weather forecasts are one example: they incorporate data from sea surface temperatures, local topography, air pressures, air temperatures and so on.
Different models use different inputs, and may combine these inputs differently to produce different (subjective) forecast probabilities.


::: {.definition #SubjectiveApproachToProbability name="Subjective approach to probability"}
In the *subjective approach to probability*, various factors are incorporated, perhaps subjectively, to determine the probability of an event occurring.
:::


::: {.example #SubjectiveProb name="Subjective probability"}

## Independence {#Independence}

One important concept in probability is *independence*.
Two events are *independent* if the probability of one event happening is the same, whether or not the other event has happened.
For example, if you toss a coin, the probability of getting a head is the same whether you are sitting or standing.
That is, the result of a coin toss is *independent* of your position.

</div>


::: {.definition #Independence name="Independence"}
Two events are *independent* if the probability of one event is the same, whether or not the other event has happened.
:::


::: {.example #IndependenceCards name="Independence"}
Consider drawing two cards from a fair pack (of 52 cards), *without* returning the first card.
For the *first* card, the sample space contains every card in the pack, and drawing any one card is as equally likely as drawing any other.
Since four cards are **Aces**, the probability of drawing an **Ace** on the first draw is 4/52 (using the classical approach to probability).

If we drew an **Ace** for the first card, the probability of drawing an **Ace** for the *second* card is 3/51 (*three* **Aces** remain among the 51 remaining cards).
Alternatively, if we *don't* draw an **Ace** for the first card, the probability of drawing an **Ace** second time is 4/51 (*four* **Aces** remain among the 51 remaining cards).

That is, the probability of drawing an **Ace** for the second card *depends* on whether or not an **Ace** was drawn for the first card.
The two events 'Drawing an **Ace** for the first card' and 'Drawing an **Ace** for the second card' are *not independent* events.

## Summary {#Chap16-Summary}

At least three ways exist to compute probabilities:

* the **classical approach**, which requires all outcomes to be *equally likely*;
* the **relative frequency** approach; and 
* the **subjective approach**.

Two events are **independent** if the probability of one event is the same, whether or not other event has happened.

::: {.exercise #IndependentEvents}
Are these pairs of two events likely to be *independent* or *not independent*? 
Explain.

1. 'Whether or not I walk to work tomorrow morning', and 'Whether or not rain is expected tomorrow morning'.
1. 'Whether or not a person smokes more than 10 cigarettes per week on average' and 'Whether or not a person get lung cancer'.
1. 'Whether or not it rains today' and 'Whether or not my rubbish is collected today'.

::: {.exercise #SensitivitySpecifity}

In disease testing, two keys aspects of the test are:

* Sensitivity*:   the probability of getting a *positive* test result among people *who do* have the disease; and
* *Specificity*:  the probability of getting a *negative* test result among people *who do not* have the disease.

Both are important for understanding how well a test works in practice.
Consider a test with a *sensitivity* of 0.99 and a *specificity* of 0.98.

1. Suppose 100 people who *do* have a disease are tested. 
   How many would be expected to return a positive test result?
1. Suppose 100 people who *do not* have a disease are tested. 
   How many would be expected to return a positive test result?

::: {.exercise #CoinOutcomes}
Consider the following argument:

> When I toss two coins, there are only three outcomes: a Head and a Head, a Tail and a Tail, or one of each. 
> So the probability of obtaining two Tails must be one-third.

The reasoning is incorrect. 
Explain *why*.

::: {.exercise #JuryService}
Since my wife and I have been married, I have been called to jury service three times.
The latest notice reads: 'Your name has been selected at random from the electoral role...'.

In the same length of time, my wife has *never* been called to jury service.
Do you think the selection process really is 'at random'?
Explain.
