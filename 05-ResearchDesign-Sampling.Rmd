## The idea of sampling {#IdeaOfSampling}\index{Sampling}

A RQ implies that every member of the population should be studied (the **P** in **P**OCI means 'population').
However, doing so is very rare due to cost, time, ethics, logistics and/or practicality.
Usually a subset of the population (a *sample*) is studied, comprising some *individuals* from the population.
*Many* different samples are possible.\index{Sample}
A study is [*externally valid*](#def:ExternalValidity) if the results from the sample can be generalised to the population, which is only possible if the sample faithfully represents the population.\index{External validity}


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The challenge of research is learning about a population from studying just one of the countless possible samples.

::: {.example #SamplesAspirin name="Samples"}
A study of the effectiveness of aspirin in treating headaches cannot possibly study every single human who may one day take aspirin.
Not only would this be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and impractical, but the study would not even study humans yet to be born who might use aspirin.

Using the whole target population is *impossible*, and a *sample* must be used.
:::


Studying a sample raises other questions:

* *Which* individuals should be included in the sample?
* *How many* individuals should be included in the sample?

The first issue is studied in this chapter.
The second issue is studied later (Chap.\ \@ref(EstimatingSampleSize)), after learning about the implications of studying samples rather than populations.

Many samples are possible, and *every sample is likely to be different*.
Hence, the results of studying a sample depend on which individuals are in the studied sample.
These differences are called *sampling variation*.
That is, each sample has different individuals, produces different data, and may lead to different answers to the RQ.


:::{.example name="Number of samples possible"}
In a 'population' as small as $100$, the number of possible samples of size $25$ is more than twice the number of people on earth.
:::


This is the challenge of research: *How to make decisions about populations, using just one of the many possible samples*.
Perhaps surprisingly, *lots* can be learnt about the population if we approach the task of selecting a sample correctly.\index{Making decisions}


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Almost always, *samples* are studied, not *populations*.
Many samples are possible, and *every sample is likely to be different*, and hence the *results from every sample are likely to be different*.
This is called *sampling variation*.

While *we can never be certain* about the conclusions from the sample, special tools allow us to make decisions about the *population* from a *sample*.

This is an example of *sampling variation*.\index{Sampling variation}

## Precision and accuracy {#PrecisionAccuracy}

Two questions concerning sampling, raised in Sect.\ \@ref(IdeaOfSampling), were: *which* individuals should be in the sample, and *how many* individuals should be in the sample.
The first question addresses the *accuracy* of a sample value to estimate a population value. 
The second addresses the *precision* with which the population value is estimated using a sample.
An estimate that is not accurate is called *biased* (Sect.\ \@ref(SelectionBias); Def.\ \@ref(def:Bias)).


::: {.definition name="Accuracy"}\index{Accuracy}
*Accuracy* refers to how close a *sample* estimate is likely to be to the *population* value, on average.
:::


::: {.definition name="Precision"}\index{Precision}
*Precision* refers to how similar the sample estimates from different samples are likely to be to each other (that is, how much variation is likely in the sample estimates).
:::


Using this language:

* The sampling *method* (i.e., *how* the sample is selected) impacts the *accuracy* of the sample estimate (i.e., the *external validity* of the study).
* The *size* of the sample impacts the *precision* of the sample estimate.

Large samples are more likely to produce *precise* estimates, but they may or may not be accurate estimates.
Similarly, random samples are likely to produce *accurate* estimates, but they may or may not be *precise*.
As an analogy, consider an archer aiming at a target.
The shots can be accurate, or precise... or ideally both (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:PrecisionAccuracy)).

## Types of sampling\index{Sampling}

One key to obtaining accurate estimates about the population from the sample (maximising externally validity) is to ensure that the sample faithfully represents the population.
So, *how* is a representative sample selected from of the population?

The individuals selected for the sample can be chosen using either *random sampling* or *non-random sampling*.
The word *random* here has a specific meaning that is different than how it is often used in everyday use.


::: {.definition #Random name="Random"}
In research and statistics, *random* means determined completely by impersonal chance.
:::


### Random sampling methods {#RandomSamples}\index{Sampling!random}

In a *random sample*, each individual in the population can be selected, and is chosen on the basis of impersonal chance (such as using a random number generator, or a table of random numbers).
Some examples of random sampling methods appear in Sects.\ \@ref(SRS) to\ \@ref(MultistageSampling), and summarised in Table\ \@ref(tab:TypesOfRandomSampling).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The results obtained from a random sample are likely to generalise to the population from which the sample is drawn; that is, *random samples* are likely to produce *externally valid* and *accurate* studies.

Testing a pot of soup is similar.
If the soup is stirred (randomised), the whole pot need not be tasted.
An *overall* impression of the population (or the soup) is not obtained. from a non-random sample (sampling from non-stirred soup).


### Non-random sampling methods {#NonRandomSamples}\index{Sampling!non-random}

A *non-random* sample is selected using some personal input from the researchers.
Examples of non-random samples include:

* *Judgement sample*:
  Individuals are selected based on the researchers' judgement (possibly unconsciously), perhaps because the individuals may appear agreeable, supportive, accessible, or helpful.
  For example, researchers may select rats that are less aggressive, or plants that are accessible.
* *Convenience sample*:
  Individuals are selected because they are convenient for the researcher.
  For example, researchers may study beaches that are nearby, or use their friends for a study.
* *Voluntary* response (self-selecting) sample:
  Individuals participate if they wish to.
  For example, researchers may ask people to volunteer to take a survey.

In non-random sampling, the individuals *in* the study may be different than those *not in* the study.
That is, *non-random samples are not likely to be externally valid*.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}

## Simple random sampling {#SRS}\index{Sampling!random!simple random}

The most straightforward idea for a random sample is a *simple* random sample.


::: {.definition #SamplingSRS SRSname="Simple random sample"}
In a *simple random sample*, *every* possible sample of the same size has the *same* chance of being selected.
:::


Selecting a simple random sample requires a list of all members of the population, called the *sampling frame*, from which to select a sample.
Often, obtaining the sampling frame is difficult or impossible, and so finding a simple random sample is also difficult.
For example, finding a simple random sample of wombats would require having a list and location of all wombats, so some could be selected.
This is absurd; other random sampling methods, like 
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  '[special ecological sampling methods](http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/what_method.htm),'
} else {
  'special ecological sampling methods,'
}`
would be used instead [@manly2014introduction].



::: {.definition #SamplingFrame name="Sampling frame"}
The *sampling frame* is a list of *all* the individuals in the population.
:::


Selecting a simple random sample from the *sampling frame* can be performed using *random numbers* (e.g., using random number tables, or 
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  'websites like https://www.random.org).  A smaller version of this webpage, which generates one number at a time, is below; just press *Generate*. The numbers generated by this widget come from the true random number generator at [RANDOM.ORG](https://www.random.org). (The webpage generates as many numbers as you want all at the same time.)'
} else {
  'websites like https://www.random.org).'
}`
Other random sampling methods use a system to select at random, rather than by human choice, and some avoid the need for a sampling frame.

::: {.example #Typing name="Simple random sampling"}
Suppose we are interested in this RQ:

> For students at a large course at a university, is the average typing speed (in words per minute) the same for those aged under $25$ ('younger') and $25$ or over ('older')?

Suppose budget and time constraints mean only $40$ students (out of $441$) can be selected for the study above.
The *sampling frame* is the list of all students enrolled in the course.
Obtaining the sampling frame is feasible here; instructors have access to this information for grading.

One way to select a simple random sample using the course enrolment list is to place all $441$ student names into a spreadsheet (ordered by name, student ID, or any way).
Then, use random numbers to select $40$ at random (without repeating numbers) between $1$ and $441$ inclusive.
For instance, when I used 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\texttt{random.org/integers},'
} else {
   '[random.org](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=40&min=1&max=441&col=5&base=10&format=html&rnd=new),'
}`
the first few random numbers were: `410`,	`215`,	`384`,	`158`,	`296`, ...

Every student chosen using this method becomes part of the study.
If a student could not be contacted, more students could be chosen at random to ensure $40$ students participated
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesA), left panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`
The sample comprises $25$\ older students and $15$\ younger students.

In *systematic sampling*, the first case is *randomly* selected; then, more individuals are selected at regular intervals thereafter.
In general, we say that every $n$th individual is selected after the initial random selection.


::: {.example #SystematicCourse name="Systematic sampling"}
For the study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), a sample of $40$ students in a course of $441$ is needed.
To find a systematic random sample, select a random number between $1$ and $441/40$ (approximately $11$) as a starting point; suppose the random number selected is $9$.

The first student selected is the $9$th person in the student list (which may be ordered alphabetically, by student ID, or other means).
Thereafter, every $441/40$th person, or $11$th person, in the list is selected: people labelled as $9$, $20$, $31$, $42$,...
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesA), right panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`
The sample comprises $23$\ older students and $17$\ younger students.

::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Care needs to be taken when using systematic samples to ensure a pattern is not hidden.
Consider taking a systematic sample of every $10$th residence on a long street.
In many countries, odd numbers are usually on one side of the street, and even numbers usually on the other side.
Selecting every $10$th house (for example) would include houses all on the same side of the street, and hence with similar exposure to the sun, traffic, etc.

In *stratified sampling*, the population is split into a *small* number of *large* (usually homogeneous) groups called *strata*, then cases are selected using a *simple random sample* from *each* stratum.
Every individual in the population must be in one, and only one, stratum.


::: {.example #StratifiedUni name="Stratified sampling"}
For the typing study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), $20$ younger and $20$ older students could be selected to obtain a sample of size $40$.
The sample is stratified by *age group* of the person
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesStrat), left panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`

Assume that about $67$% of the students are younger in the population.
To ensure that two-thirds of the sample of size $40$ comprised younger students, $27$ younger students would be selected in the sample
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesStrat), right panel).'

In *cluster sampling*, the population is split into a *large* number of *small* groups called *clusters*.
Then, a *simple random sample* of clusters is selected, and *every* member of the chosen clusters become part of the sample.
Every individual in the population must be in one, and only one, cluster.


::: {.example name="Cluster sampling"}
For the study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), a simple random sample of (say) three of the many small-group classes for the course could be selected, and *every* student enrolled in those selected small groups constitute the sample
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesB), left panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`
Due to the classes chosen, the sample size is $n = 43$ ($30$\ older; $13$\ younger).

</div>


In *multistage sampling*, larger collections of individuals are selected using a *simple random sample*, then smaller collections of individuals *within* those large collections are selected using a *simple random sample*.
The simple random sampling continues for as many levels as necessary, until individuals are being selected (at random).


::: {.example name="Multistage sampling"}
For the study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), a *simple random sample* of ten of the many small-group classes could be selected (Stage\ 1), and then four students are *randomly* selected from each of these $10$ selected tutorials (Stage 2)
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesB), right panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`
The sample size is $10\times 4 = 40$, comprising $24$\ older students and $16$\ younger students.
:::




```{r animation.hook="gifski", interval=0.75, fig.height = 6.5, dev=if (is_latex_output()){"pdf"}else{"png"}}
if (knitr::is_html_output()){

  source("R/showSampleMultistage.R")
  showSampleMultistage(static = FALSE)  
}  
```




::: {.example name="Multistage sampling"}
Multistage sampling is often used by statistics agencies.
For example, to obtain a multistage random sample from a country:

* **Stage\ 1**: Randomly select some cities in the nation;
* **Stage\ 2**: Randomly select some suburbs in these chosen cities;
* **Stage\ 3**: Randomly select some streets in these chosen suburbs;
* **Stage\ 4**: Randomly select some houses in these chosen streets.

This is cheaper than [simple random sampling](#SRS), as data collectors can be deployed in a small number of cities (only those chosen in Stage\ 1).
:::




## Representative sampling {#Representative-samples}\index{Sampling!representative}

Obtaining a truly random sample is usually hard or impossible.
In practice, sometimes the best compromise is to select a sample diverse enough to be *somewhat representative* of the diversity in the population: where those *in* the sample are not likely to be different than those *not in* the sample (in any obvious way), at least for the variables of interest.

As always, the results from any non-random sample *may not generalise* to the intended population (but generalise to the population which the sample *does* represent).


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-thisisengineering-3912979.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example name="Representative sample"}
Suppose we wish to evaluate the *functionality* of two types of hand prosthetics.

A randomly-chosen group of Alaskan and Texan residents is asked for their feedback, probably (but not certainly) their views would be similar to those of all Americans.
No obvious reason exists for why residents of Alaska and Texas would be very different from residents in the rest of the United States, regarding their view of hand prosthetics functionality.
	
Even though the sample is not a random sample of all Americans, the results *may* generalise to all Americans (though we cannot be sure).
:::

</div>


::: {.example #AirConUse name="Non-representative samples"}
Suppose we wish to determine the average time per day that Americans households use their air-conditioners for *cooling* in summer. 

If a group of Texas residents is asked, this sample would not be expected to represent all Americans: it would *over*-represent the average number of hours air-conditioners are used for *cooling* in summer.
In this case, those *in* the sample are likely to be very different to those *not in* the sample, regarding their air-conditioners usage for *cooling* in summer.

In contrast, suppose a group of Alaskans was asked the same question.
This second sample would not be expected to represent all Americans either (it would *under*-represent).
Again, those *in* the sample are likely to be very different to those *not in* the sample, regarding their air-conditioners usage for *cooling* in summer.
:::


Sometimes, a *combination* of sampling methods is used.\index{Sampling!combination of methods}

		
::: {.example name="A combination of sampling methods"}
In a study of pathogens present on magazines in doctors' surgeries in Melbourne, some suburbs can be selected at *random*, and then (within each suburb) all surgeries are contacted, and some surgeries *volunteer* to be part of the study. 
:::


:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
In a study of diets of children at child-care centres, researchers used samples in 2010 and 2016, described as follows [@larson2019staff, p.\ 336]:

> In 2010, a stratified random sampling procedure was used to select representative cross-sections of providers working in licensed center-based programs and licensed providers of family home-based care from publicly available lists. 
> [...] Additional participants were also recruited in 2016 using a combination of stratified random and open, convenience-based sampling.
:::


Sometimes, practicalities dictate how the sample is obtained, which may result in a non-random sample.
Even so, the impact of using a non-random sample on the conclusions should be discussed (Chap.\ \@ref(Interpretation)).
Sometimes, ways exist to obtain a sample that is *more likely* to be representative.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Random samples are often difficult to obtain, and sometimes *representative* samples are the best that can be done.
In a representative sample, those *in* the sample are not obviously different than those *not in* the sample.
Try to ensure that a broad cross-section of the target population appears in the sample.

::: {.example #StratifiedUni name="Representative sample"}
For the typing study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), only selecting students who are attending the gym, or only students who are at a certain Cafe, is unlikely to be somewhat representative of the whole student population.

Instead, the researchers could approach:

* Students at the cafe on Monday at $8$am;
* Students at the gym on Tuesday at $11$:$30$am; and
* Students entering the Library on Thursdays at $2$pm.

This is still not a *random* sample, but the sample now is likely to comprises a variety of student types.
Ideally, *students would not be included more than once in our sample*, though this is often difficult to ensure.

To determine if the sample is somewhat representative of the population, sometimes information about the sample and population can be compared.
The researchers may then be able to make some comment about whether the sample seems reasonably representative.
For example, the sex and age of a sample of university students may be recorded; if the proportion of females in the sample, and the average age of students in the sample, are similar to those of the whole university population, then the sample may be somewhat representative of the population (though we cannot be sure).

## Bias in sampling {#SelectionBias}\index{Sampling!bias}
   
The sample may not be representative of the population for many reasons, all of which compromise how well the sample represents the population (i.e., compromises *external* validity and accuracy).
This is called *selection bias*.



::: {.definition #SelectionBias name="Selection bias"}\index{Bias!selection}
*Selection bias* is the tendency of a sample to over- or under-estimate a population quantity.
:::


Selection bias is less common in studies with [forward directionality](#ForwardsStudies), compared to studies that are [non-directional](#NondirectionalStudies) or have [backward directionality](#BackwardsStudies) (Sect.\ \@ref(Directionality)).
*Selection bias* may occur if the wrong sampling frame is used, or non-random sampling is used.
The sample is [biased](#def:Bias) because those *in* the sample may be different than those *not in* the sample (and this may not always be obvious).
Biased samples are less likely to produce externally valid studies.


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-juergen-striewski-301048.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example name="Selection bias"}
Consider Example\ \@ref(exm:AirConUse), about estimating the average time per day that air conditioners are used for cooling in summer.
Using people only from Alaska in the sample is using the wrong sampling frame: the sampling frame does not represent the target population ('Americans').
This is *selection bias*.
:::


*Non-response bias* occurs when chosen participants do not respond for some reason.\index{Bias!non-response}
The problem is that those who *do not* respond may be different than those who *do* respond.
Non-response bias can occur because of a poorly-designed survey, using voluntary-response sampling, chosen participants refusing to participate, participants forgetting to return completed surveys, etc.


::: {.example #BiasOvertime name="Non-response bias"}
Consider a study to determine the average number of hours of overtime worked by various professions.
People who work a large amount of overtime may be too busy to answer the survey.
Those who answer the survey may be likely to work less overtime than those who do not answer the survey.
This is an (extreme) example of *non-response bias*.
:::


*Response bias* occurs when participants provide *incorrect information*: the answers provided by the participants may not reflect the truth.\index{Bias!response}
This may be intentional (for example, when researchers intend to deceive) or non-intentional (for example, if the question is poorly written, is personal, or is misunderstood).


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
Consider using these samples:\label{thinkBox:TypesOfSamples}
\vspace{-2ex}

1. Obtaining data using a telephone survey.

## Chapter summary {#Chap5-Summary}

Almost always, the entire population of interest cannot be studied, so a *sample* (a subset of the population) must be studied.
*Many* samples are possible; we only study one sample.
Samples can be *random* or *non-random*.
Conclusions made from random samples can usually be generalized to the population (that is, they are externally valid and accurate).

Random sampling methods include *simple random samples*, *systematic samples*, *stratified samples*, *cluster samples*, and *multi-stage samples*.
Random samples are likely to be *externally valid* and *accurate*.

Non-random sampling methods include *convenience samples*, *judgement samples*, and *self-selecting samples*.
Random samples are often very difficult to obtain, so the best we can do is to aim for *reasonably representative* samples, where those *in* the sample are unlikely to be very different than those *not in* the sample.
Non-random samples *may not be externally valid* or *accurate*.

## Exercises {#SamplingExercises}

Selected answers are available in Sect.\ \@ref(SamplingAnswer).

::: {.exercise #SamplingSystematicProblem}
A researcher has three months in which to collected the data for a study on car park usage.
Suppose the researcher wants to take a systematic sample of days, and on each of the selected days records the number of cars in the car park.

To select the days in which to collect data, she decides (by using random numbers) to start data collection on a Tuesday, and then every $7$th day thereafter.

1. What problem is evident in this sampling scheme? 
2. What suggestions would you give to improve the sampling?
:::

::: {.exercise #SamplingBooks}
Suppose you need to estimate the average number of pages in a book in a university library (with five campuses), using a sample of $200$ books.
Describe how to select a sample of books using:

:::::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.42\textwidth}"}

1. a *simple random sample* of books.
2. a *stratified sample* of books.
3. a *cluster sample* of books.

::::::

Which sampling scheme would be most *practical*?
:::


::: {.exercise #SamplingApartments}
Suppose you need a sample of residents from apartments in a large residential complex, comprising $30$ floors with $15$ apartments on each floor.
You plan to survey the residents of these apartments.
For each of the possible sampling schemes given below, first describe the sampling scheme, and then determine which methods are likely to give random (or representative) sample (explaining your answers).

The four possible sampling schemes are:

1. *Randomly* select five floors, then *randomly* select four apartments from each of those five floors, and interview the oldest resident of that apartment.
2. *Randomly* select one floor, and select the $15$ apartments on that floor, then interview the oldest resident of that apartment.
3. Wait at the ground-floor elevator, and ask people who emerge to complete the survey.
4. *Randomly* select five floors, then wait by the elevator on those floors and survey residents as they arrive at the elevator.
:::


::: {.exercise #SamplingShoppingCentre}
Suppose a researcher needs a sample of customers at a large, local shopping centre to complete a questionnaire.
Four sampling schemes are listed below.

For each, describe the type of sampling.
Then, determine which would be the best method (explain why), and determine which (if any)  produce a random sample.

The four possible sampling schemes are:

1. The researcher locates themselves outside the supermarket at the shopping centre one morning, and approaches every $10$th person who walks past. 
2. The researcher waits at the main entrance for $30$ minutes at $8$am every morning for a week, and approaches every $5$th person. 
3. The researcher leaves a pile of survey forms at an unattended booth in the shopping centre, and a locked barrel in which to place completed surveys.
4. The researcher goes to the shopping centre every day for two weeks, at a different time and location each day, and approaches someone every $15$\ mins.
:::



::: {.exercise #SamplingSchools}
A study [@ridgewell2009school] investigated how children in Brisbane travel to state schools. 
Researchers randomly sampled four schools from a list of all Brisbane state schools, and invited every family at each of those four schools to complete a survey.

What *type* of sampling method is this?
How could the researchers determine if the resulting sample was approximately representative?
:::


::: {.exercise #SamplingMalaria}
A study comparing two new malaria vaccines recruited $200$ Kenyans who had contracted malaria.
These recruits were obtained by approaching all patients with a confirmed malaria diagnosis who were admitted to hospitals.
Patients could volunteer for the study or not.
The study was then conducted to a high standard.
Which of the following statements are *true*?  

1. This is a voluntary response sample. `r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer = TRUE) }`
2. The study is likely to have high *external* validity. `r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer = FALSE) }`
3. The sample size is too small for the study results to provide useful information. `r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer = FALSE) }`
:::



::: {.exercise #SamplingForest}
Suppose a natural forest region is classified into two quite different zones.
Zone\ A is mostly dunes and lightly vegetated, and on the coastal side of a ridge; Zone\ B is more densely vegetated and on the inland side of the ridge. 

A random sample of sugar ants (*Camponotus app*) is taken from Zone\ A, and another random sample of sugar ants from Zone\ B, to study the average size of the ants.
What is the best description of the *type* of sampling method being used?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
	         "Simple random sampling",
	         "Cluster sampling",
	answer = "Stratified sampling",
	         "Multi-stage sampling",
	         "Voluntary response sampling"))}`
:::



::: {.exercise #BiasOnline}
One (actual) survey in 2001 concluded (@data:Heiger:Homebuyer, cited in @bock2010stats, p.\ 283):

> All but $2$% of the home buyers have at least one computer at home, and $62$% have two or more.
> Of those with a computer, $99$% are connected to the internet.

The article later reveals the survey was conducted *online* (recall the survey was conducted in 2001).
The target population is home buyers; however, home buyers *with* internet access were far more likely to complete the survey than home owners *without* internet access.

What type of bias is this?
:::




::: {.exercise #NotMultistageSampling}
Researchers are studying the percentage of farms that use a specific management technique.
The researchers *randomly* select $20$ regions around the country, then select farms within each region by asking for farmers to volunteer to be in the study.

Explain why this is *not* a multistage sample, and what changes are necessary for the researchers to have a multistage sample.
:::


::: {.exercise #NotClusterSampling}
Researchers are comparing the average time that experienced and first-year school teachers spend in the sun.
The researchers select some schools by asking school principals to volunteer their schools, then record information for *every* teacher in those schools.

Explain why this is *not* a cluster sample, and what changes are necessary for the researchers to have a cluster sample.
