## The idea of sampling {#IdeaOfSampling}

A RQ implies that every member of the population should be studied (the **P** in **P**OCI stand for 'population').
However, doing so is very rare due to cost, time, ethics, logistics and/or practicality.
Usually, a subset of the population (a *sample*) is studied, comprising some *individuals* from the population.
*Many* different samples are possible.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The challenge of research is learning about a population from studying just one of the many possible samples.
:::


A study is [*externally valid*](#def:ExternalValidity) if the results can be generalised to other groups in the population, apart from the sample studied.
This is only possible if the sample is chosen to well-represent the whole population.

::: {.example #SamplesAspirin name="Samples"}
A study (based on @data:aspirin:headaches) of the effectiveness of aspirin in treating headaches cannot possibly study every single human who may one day wish to take aspirin.
Not only would this be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and impractical, but the study would not even study humans yet to be born who might use aspirin.

Using the whole target population is *impossible*, and a *sample* must be used.
:::


Having seen that using a sample is necessary, other questions emerge:

* *Which* individuals should be included in the sample?
* *How many* individuals should be included in the sample?

The first issue is studied in this chapter.
The second issue is left until later (Sect. \@ref(EstimatingSampleSize)), after learning more about the implications of studying a sample rather than a population.

Using a sample instead of the entire population presents challenges.
Many samples are possible, and *every sample is likely to be different*, so what is learnt from a sample depends on which individuals happen to be in the sample studied.
This is called *sampling variation*.
That is, each sample has different individuals, produces different data, and may lead to different answers to the RQ.

This is the challenge of research: *How to make decisions about populations, using just one of the many possible samples*.
Perhaps surprisingly, *lots* can be learnt about the population if we approach the task of selecting a sample correctly.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Almost always, *samples* are studied, not *populations*.
Many samples are possible, and *every sample is likely to be different*, and hence the *results from every sample are likely to be different*.
This is called *sampling variation*.

While *we can never be certain* about the conclusions from the sample, special tools allow us to make decisions about the *population* from a *sample*.

## Precision and accuracy {#PrecisionAccuracy}

Two questions concerning sampling, raised in Sect. \@ref(IdeaOfSampling), were:

* *which* individuals should be in the sample; and
* *how many* individuals should be in the sample.

The first question addresses *accuracy* of any population quantity estimated from the sample, while the second addresses *precision* with which the population quantity is estimated using the sample.


::: {.definition name="Accuracy"}
*Accuracy* refers to how close a *sample* estimate is to the *population* value, on average.
:::


::: {.definition name="Precision"}
*Precision* refers to how similar the sample estimates from different samples are likely to be to each other (that is, how much variation is likely in the sample estimates).
:::


Using this language:

* The sampling *method* (i.e., how the sample is selected) impacts the *accuracy* of the sample estimate (i.e., the *external validity* of the study).
* The *size* of the sample impacts the *precision* of the sample estimate.

Large samples are more likely to produce *precise* estimates; however, they may or may not be accurate estimates.
Similarly, random samples are likely to produce *accurate* estimates (and hence the study is more likely to be externally valid), but they may not be *precise* unless the sample is also large.

As an analogy, consider an archer aiming at a target.
The shots can be accurate, or precise... or ideally both (Fig. \@ref(fig:PrecisionAccuracy)).
An estimate that is not accurate is called *biased* (Def. \@ref(def:Bias)).

## Types of sampling

One key to obtaining accurate estimates about the population is to ensure that the sample is representative of the population of interest (that is, to ensure the study is externally valid).
So, *how* can we find a representative sample of the population?
The individuals selected for the sample can be chosen using either *random sampling* or *non-random sampling*.

The word *random* here has a specific meaning that is different than how it is often used in everyday use.

::: {.definition #Random name="Random"}
In research and statistics, *random* means determined completely by impersonal chance.
:::


### Random sampling methods {#RandomSamples}

In a *random sample*, each individual in the population can be selected on the basis of impersonal chance (such as using a random number generator, or a table of random numbers).
Some examples of random sampling methods appear in the following sections (Table \@ref(tab:TypesOfRandomSampling)).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The results obtained from a random sample are likely to generalise to the population from which the sample is drawn; that is, *random samples* are likely to produce *externally valid* and *accurate* studies.

Testing a pot of soup by 'sampling' is similar.
If the soup is stirred (randomised), the whole pot of soup does not need to be tasted.
Using a non-random sample (sampling from the non-stirred soup), an *overall* impression of the population (or the soup) is not obtained.


### Non-random sampling methods {#NonRandomSamples}

A *non-random* sample is selected using some input from the researchers.
Examples of non-random samples include:

* *Judgement sample*:
  Individuals are selected based on the researchers' judgement, perhaps because the individuals may be agreeable, supportive, accessible, or helpful.
  For example, researchers may select rats that are less aggressive, or plants that are accessible.
* *Convenience sample*:
  Individuals are selected because they are convenient for the researcher.
  For example, researchers may study beaches that are geographically close.
* *Voluntary* response (self-selecting) sample:
  Individuals participate if they wish to.
  For example, researchers may ask people to volunteer for a survey.

In non-random sampling, the individuals *in* the study may be different than those *not in* the study.
That is, *non-random samples are not likely to be externally valid*.
<!-- In Sect. \@ref(Final-Example), *random* and *non-random samples* are compared visually using an example. -->


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Using a non-random sample means that the results probably do not generalise to the intended population: they probably do not produce externally valid or accurate studies.

::: {.definition #SamplingSRS SRSname="Simple random sample"}
In a *simple random sample*, *every* possible sample of the same size has the *same* chance of being selected.
:::

Selecting a simple random sample requires a list of all members of the population, called the *sampling frame*, from which to make the selections.
Often, establishing the sampling frame is difficult or impossible, and so finding a simple random sample is also difficult.
For example, finding a simple random sample of wombats would require having a list and location of all wombats, so some could be selected using random numbers.
This is absurd; other random sampling methods, like 
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  '[special ecological sampling methods](http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/what_method.htm),'
} else {
  'special ecological sampling methods,'
}`
would be used instead [@manly2014introduction].



::: {.definition #SamplingFrame name="Sampling frame"}
The *sampling frame* is a list of *all* the individuals in the population.
:::


Selecting a simple random sample from the *sampling frame* can be performed using *random numbers* (e.g., Appendix \@ref(AppendixRandomNumbers) or 
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  'websites like https://www.random.org).  A smaller version of this webpage, which generates one number at a time, is below; just press *Generate*. The numbers generated by this widget come from the true random number generator at [RANDOM.ORG](https://www.random.org). (The webpage generates as many numbers as you want all at the same time.)'
} else {

For the study above, a sample of 40 students in a course of 441 is needed.
To find a systematic sample, select a random between 1 and $441/40$ (approximately 11) as a starting point; suppose the random number selected is 9.
Then, the first student selected is the 9th person in the spreadsheet list (which may be ordered alphabetically, by student ID, or any other means).
Thereafter, every $441/40$th person, or 11th person, in the list is selected: people in rows 9, 20, 31, 42...

Care needs to be taken when using systematic samples to ensure a pattern is not hidden.
Consider taking a systematic sample of every 10th residence on a long street.
In many countries, odd numbers are usually on one side of the street, and even numbers usually on the other side.
Selecting every 10th house (for example) would include houses all on the same side of the street, and hence with similar exposure to the sun, traffic, etc.

In *stratified sampling*, the population is split into a *small* number of *large* (usually homogeneous) groups called *strata*, then cases are selected using a *simple random sample* from *each* stratum.
Every individual in the population must be in one, and only one, stratum.


::: {.example #StratifiedUni name="Stratified sampling"}
To select 40 students in a large course at a particular university, 20 females and 20 males could be selected.
The sample is stratified by *sex* of the person.

At the university where I work, about 67% of the students are females.
So, I could ensure that two-thirds of the sample of size 40 comprised females (around 26.7, say 27) and about one-third males (about 13.3, say 13).

In *cluster sampling*, the population is split into a *large* number of *small* groups called *clusters*, then a *simple random sample* of clusters is selected and *every* member of the chosen small groups is part of the sample.
Every individual in the population must be in one, and only one, cluster.


::: {.example name="Cluster sampling"}
To select students in a large course at a particular university again, a simple random sample of (say) three of the many tutorials could be selected, and *every* student enrolled in those selected tutorials constitute the sample.

<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-view-4-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


In *multistage sampling*, large collections of individuals are selected using a *simple random sample*, then smaller collections of individuals *within* those large collections are selected using a *simple random sample*.
The simple random sampling can continue for as many levels as necessary, until individuals are being selected (at random).


::: {.example name="Multistage sampling"}
To select students in a large course at a particular university again, a *simple random sample* of (say) ten of the many tutorials could be selected (Stage 1), and then 4 people *randomly* selected from each of these 10 selected tutorials (Stage 2).
:::


`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Figure \\@ref(fig:SamplesB) (right panel) shows a diagram of selecting approximately 40 students using multistage sampling, by randomly selecting 10 classes at random in Stage 1, then randomly selecting students from each class in Stage 2. (The online version has an animation.)'

if (knitr::is_html_output()){

  source("R/showSampleMultistage.R")
  showSampleMultistage(static=FALSE) 
}  
```




::: {.example name="Multistage sampling"}
Multistage sampling is often used by national statistics agencies.
For example, to obtain a multistage random sample from a country, here is one approach:

* **Stage 1**: Randomly select some cities in the country;
* **Stage 2**: Randomly select some suburbs in these chosen cities;
* **Stage 3**: Randomly select some streets in these chosen suburbs;
* **Stage 4**: Randomly select some houses in these chosen streets.

This is cheaper than [simple random sampling](#SRS), as data collectors can be deployed in a small number of cities (only those chosen in Stage 1).
:::




## Representative sampling {#Representative-samples}

Obtaining a *truly* random sample is usually hard or impossible.
In practice, sometimes the best compromise is to select a sample diverse enough to be *somewhat representative* of the diversity in the population: where those *in* the sample are not likely to be different than those *not in* the sample, at least for the variables of interest.

As always, the results from any non-random sample *may not generalise* to the intended population.
The results will generalise to the population which the sample *does* represent.


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-thisisengineering-3912979.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example name="Representative sample"}
A randomly-chosen group of Queensland and Northern Territory residents is asked to evaluate two types of hand prosthetics.

Probably (but not certainly) their views would be similar to those of all Australians.
There is no obvious reason why residents of Queensland and the Northern Territory would be very different from residents in the rest of Australia, regarding their view of hand prosthetics.
	
Even though the sample is not a random sample of all Australians, the results *may* generalise to all Australians (though we cannot be sure).
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-juergen-striewski-301048.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example #AirConUse name="Non-representative samples"}
Suppose we wish to determine the average time per day that Australian households use their air-conditioners for *cooling* in summer. 

If a group of Northern Territory residents is asked, this sample would not be expected to represent all Australians: it would *over*-represent the average number of hours air-conditioners are used for *cooling* in summer.
In this case, those *in* the sample are likely to be very different to those *not in* the sample, regarding their air-conditioners usage for *cooling* in summer.

In contrast, suppose a group of Tasmanians was asked the same question.
This second sample would not be expected to represent all Australians either (it would *under*-represent).
Again, those *in* the sample are likely to be very different to those *not in* the sample, regarding their air-conditioners usage for *cooling* in summer.
:::


Sometimes, a *combination* of different sampling methods is used.

		
::: {.example name="A combination of sampling methods"}
In a study of pathogens present on magazines in doctors' surgeries in Melbourne, some suburbs can be selected at *random*, and then (within each suburb) surgeries are used which *volunteer* to be part of the study. 
:::


:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
In a study of diets of children at child-care centres, researchers used samples in 2010 and 2016, described as follows:

> In 2010, a stratified random sampling procedure was used to select representative cross-sections of providers working in licensed center-based programs and licensed providers of family home-based care from publically available lists. 
> [...] Additional participants were also recruited in 2016 using a combination of stratified random and open, convenience-based sampling. 
>
> --- @larson2019staff, p. 336
:::


Sometimes, practicalities dictate how the sample can be obtained, which may not result in a random sample.
Even so, the impact of this on the conclusions should be noted (that is, in discussing the limitations of the study).
Sometimes, ways exist to obtain a sample that is *more likely* to be representative.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Random samples are often difficult to obtain, and sometimes *representative* samples are the best that can be done.
In a good representative sample, those *in* the sample are not obviously different than those *not in* the sample.
Try to ensure a broad cross-section of the target population appears in the sample.

::: {.example name="Attempts to increase representativeness"}
To find a sample of university students, students at given cafe (Cafe A) could be approached every Monday morning at 8am, for four consecutive weeks.
This is a *convenience* sample, and not a random sample.
However, the sample would be *more likely* to be representative if a broader cross-section of students was approached.
The above sample only comprises Monday-morning early starters.
Instead, the researchers could approach:

* Students at Cafe A on Monday at 8am;
* Students at the gym on Tuesday at 11:30am; and
* Students entering the Library on Thursdays at 2pm.

This is still not a *random* sample, but the sample now comprises more than just students who attend university on Mondays at 8am, at Cafe A.
Ideally, *students would not be included more than once in our sample*, though this is difficult to ensure.

To determine if the sample is somewhat representative of the population, sometimes information about the sample and population can be compared.
The researchers may then be able to make some comment about whether our sample seems reasonably representative.

For example, the sex and age of a sample of university students may be recorded; if the proportion of females in the sample, and the average age of students in the sample, are similar to those of the whole university population, then the sample may be somewhat representative of the population (though we cannot be sure).

A study of the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by Americans [@egbue2017mass] used a sample of $121$ people found through social media (such as Facebook) and professional engineering channels.
This is *not* a random sample.
The authors compared some characteristics of the sample with the American population from the 2010 census (Table \@ref(tab:EVAsdoptCompare)); they found the sample contained a higher proportion of males than the US population, a higher proportion of people aged 18--44 than the US population, and a higher proportion of wealthy individuals compared to the US population [@egbue2017mass].

## Bias in sampling {#SelectionBias}
   
The sample may not be representative of the population for many reasons, all of which compromise how well the sample represents the population (i.e., compromises *external* validity and accuracy).
This is called *sampling bias*.
Biased samples are less likely to produce externally valid studies.
Selection bias is less common in studies with [forward directionality](#ForwardsStudies), compared to studies that are [non-directional](#NondirectionalStudies) or have [backward directionality](#BackwardsStudies) (Sect. \@ref(Directionality)).


::: {.definition #SelectionBias name="Selection bias"}
*Selection bias* is the tendency of a sample to over- or under-estimate a population quantity.
:::


In *selection bias*, the wrong sampling frame may be used, or non-random sampling is used.
The sample is [biased](#def:Bias) because those *in* the sample may be different than those *not in* the sample (and this may not be obvious).


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-juergen-striewski-301048.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example name="Selection bias"}
Consider Example \@ref(exm:AirConUse), about estimating the average time per day that air conditioners are used for cooling in summer.
Using people only from the Northern Territory in the sample is using the wrong sampling frame: the sampling frame does not represent the target population ('Australians').
This is *selection bias*.
:::


*Non-response bias* occurs when chosen participants do not respond for some reason.
The problem is that the responses from those who *do not* respond may be different than the responses of those who *do* respond.
Non-response bias can occur because of a poorly-designed survey, using voluntary-response sampling, chosen participants refusing to participate, participants forgetting to return completed surveys, etc.


::: {.example name="Non-response bias"}
Consider a study to determine the average number of hours of overtime worked by various professions.
People who work a large amount of overtime may be too busy to answer the survey.
Those who answer the survey may be likely to work less overtime than those who do not answer the survey.
This is an (extreme) example of *non-response bias*.
:::


*Response bias* occurs when participants provide *incorrect information*: the answers provided by the participants may not reflect the truth.
This may be intentional (for example, if the survey questions are very personal or controversial in nature) or non-intentional (for example, if the question is poorly written or is misunderstood).


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
One (true) survey in 2001 concluded (@data:Heiger:Homebuyer, cited in @bock2010stats, p. 283):\label{thinkBox:ComputerBias}

> All but 2% of the home buyers have at least one computer at home, and 62% have two or more.
> Of those with a computer, 99% are connected to the internet.

The article later reveals the survey was conducted *online* (and recall the survey was conducted in 2001...).
What type of bias is apparent?

## Summary {#Chap5-Summary}

Almost always, the entire population of interest cannot be studied, so a *sample* (a subset of the population) must be studied.
*Many* samples are possible; we will only end up studying one.
Samples can be *random* or *non-random*.
Conclusions made from random samples can usually be generalized to the population (that is, they are externally valid and accurate).

Random sampling methods include *simple random samples*, *systematic samples*, *stratified samples*, *cluster samples*, and *multi-stage samples*.
Random samples are likely to be *externally valid* and *accurate*.

Non-random sampling methods include *convenience samples*, *judgement samples*, and *self-selecting samples*.
Random samples are often very difficult to obtain, so the best we can do is to aim for *reasonably representative* samples, where those *in* the sample are unlikely to be different than those *not in* the sample.
Non-random samples *may not be externally valid* or *accurate*.

Selected answers are available in Sect. \@ref(SamplingAnswer).

::: {.exercise #SamplingBooks}
Suppose you need to estimate the average number of pages in a book in a university library (with five campuses), using a sample of 200 books.

1. Describe how to select a *simple random sample* of books.
1. Describe how to select a *stratified sample* of books.
1. Describe how to select a *cluster sample* of books.
1. Describe how to select a *convenience sample* of books.

1. Which sampling scheme would be most *practical*?
:::


::: {.exercise #SamplingApartments}
Suppose you need a sample of 20 residents from apartments in a large residential complex, comprising 20 floors with 30 apartments on each floor.
You plan to survey the residents of these apartments.
For each of the possible sampling schemes given below, (1) describe the sampling scheme; and (2) determine which methods are good, and which are poor (explaining your answers).

The four possible sampling schemes are:

a. Randomly select five floors, then randomly select four apartments from each of those five floors, and interview the oldest resident of that apartment.
b. Randomly select one floor, and select the first 20 apartments on that floor, then interview the oldest resident of that apartment.
c. Wait at the ground-floor elevator, and ask people who emerge to participate in our interview.
d. Randomly select five floors, then wait by the elevator and interview residents as they arrive at the elevator.
:::


::: {.exercise #SamplingShoppingCentre}
Suppose a researcher needs a sample of customers who shop at a large, local shopping centre to complete a questionnaire.
Four possible sampling schemes are listed below, describe these sampling methods.

Then, determine which would be the best sampling method (explain why), and determine Which (if any) of the methods produce a random sample.

The four possible sampling schemes are:

a. The researcher stations themselves outside the supermarket at the shopping centre one morning, and approaches every 10th person who walks past. 
b. The researcher waits at the main entrance for 30 minutes at 8am every morning for a week, and approaches every 5th person. 
c. The researcher leaves a pile of survey forms at an unattended booth in the shopping centre, and a locked barrel in which to place completed surveys.
d. The researcher goes to the shopping centre every day for two weeks, at a different time and location each day, and approaches someone every 15 minutes.
:::



::: {.exercise #SamplingSchools}
A study [@ridgewell2009school] investigated how children in Brisbane travel to state schools. 
Researchers randomly sampled four schools from a list of all Brisbane state schools, and invited every family at each of those four schools to complete a survey.
What type of sampling method is this?
:::



::: {.exercise #SamplingMalaria}
A study comparing two new malaria vaccines recruited 200 Americans who had contracted malaria.
These recruits were obtained by approaching all patients with a confirmed malaria diagnosis who were admitted to hospitals.
Patients could volunteer for the study or not.
The study was then conducted to a high standard.
Which of the following statements are **true**?  

a. This is a voluntary response sample. `r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer = TRUE) }`
b. The study is likely to have high *external* validity. `r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer = FALSE) }`
c. The sample size is too small for the study results to be useful for the general population. `r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer = FALSE) }`
:::



::: {.exercise #SamplingForest}
Suppose a natural forest region is classified into two quite different zones.
Zone A is mostly dunes and lightly vegetated, and on the coastal side of a ridge; Zone B is more densely vegetated and on the inland side of the ridge. 

A random sample of sugar ants (*Camponotus app*) is taken from Zone A, and another random sample of sugar ants from Zone B, to study the average size of the ants.
What is the best description of the *type* of sampling method being used?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
	         "Simple random sampling",
	         "Cluster sampling",
	answer = "Stratified sampling",
	         "Multi-stage sampling",
	         "Voluntary response sampling"))}`

**Answers to in-chapter questions:**

- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:SRS40Students}: Place the list of all 441 students enrolled in the course into a spreadsheet; use random numbers to select 40 at random (without repeating numbers) between 1 and 441 inclusive.
Every student chosen using this method would be in the study.
If a student could not be contacted, more students could be chosen at random to ensure 40 students participated.
- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:ComputerBias}: **Selection bias**: The wrong sampling frame is used: Only home buyers with internet access, rather than all home buyers.
- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:TypesOfSamples}:
Many correct answers; for example: 1. The percentage of people that own a telephone. 2. The percentage of people that are shift-workers 3. The percentage of people studying at university.
- \textbf{\textit{Quick Revision} questions:}
**1.** Non-response bias.
**2.** Externally-valid study more likely.
**3.** Precise estimates more likely.
**4.** False.
**5.** Stratified; simple random; cluster; multi-stage.
