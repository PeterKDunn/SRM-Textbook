Consider the letter-typing RQ again (from Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing)):

> For students at a large course at a university, is the average typing speed (in words per minute) the same for females and males?

For this study, the *population* is 'Students enrolled in the course' and the *outcome* is 'the average typing speed'.
The between-individuals *comparison* is between females and males, and there is no *intervention*.
The study is *observational*.

The typing speeds (the *response variable*) of the many individuals will vary (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:VariationPartitioned); left bars): every student in the study will record the same typing speed is unlikely.
The variation in the typing speeds may be due to many reasons (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:Influences)):

* *The explanatory variable* (Sect.\ \@ref(FactorYExplanatory)):
  The values of the explanatory variable may influence the values of the response variable.
  Of course, they may not either; the purpose of the study is to find if, or to what extent, this is true.
  In this example, the *explanatory variable* is the sex of the student.
* *Other variables*, called *extraneous variables* (Sect.\ \@ref(ExtraneousVariables)):
  *Other* variables (apart from the explanatory variable) may influence the response variable (perhaps more so than the explanatory variable) such as 'age', or 'whether or not the person wears glasses'. 
  The impact of these variables can be understood if the study is designed appropriately.
* *Design issues*  (Sect.\ \@ref(StudyDesign)):
  The way the study is *designed* can also influence the values of the response variable.
  These can mean *disaster* if not managed properly.
* *Chance*, or *randomness* (Sect.\ \@ref(Chance)):
  Even the same person doing the same thing repeatedly under the same conditions will not record exactly the same typing speed every attempt.
  This is unavoidable, but good design can minimize the size of this variation.

The purpose of the study is to explore the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variable... but other issues can obscure that relationship.
An [*internally valid*](#def:InternalValidity) study is designed to focus on the relationship between the response and explanatory variables, and eliminating or understanding other influences (such as *extraneous variables*, *design issues*, and *chance*) as far as possible (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:VariationPartitioned)).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
One goal of study design is to maximise internal validity: to isolate the relationship of interest, by eliminating, as far as possible, all other possible explanations.
:::


Internal validity is one of the most important properties of scientific studies, and is important for reasoning about evidence more generally.
Designing studies to maximise internal validity is the focus of Chaps.\ \@ref(DesignExperiment) (experimental studies) and\ \@ref(DesignObservational) (observational studies).
This chapter provides an overview.


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
Data collection is often tedious, time consuming and expensive.
You usually get one chance to collect data, but data can be analysed as many times as necessary.
Design the study properly the first time!
:::


## Bias {#Bias}

*Bias* refers to any misrepresentation that can lead to a false conclusion. 
Bias compromises the results or inferences in a study, which may lead to inaccurate conclusions.
*Bias* can be introduced at any part of the research process, including the sampling (Sect.\ \@ref(SelectionBias)).


::: {.definition #Bias name="Bias"}
*Bias* refers to anything systematic which may cause differences between sample statistics and population parameters.
:::


Bias may occur during study design (poor internal validity), data collection (selection bias; Sect.\ \@ref(def:SelectionBias)), analysis, or interpretation of results (Sect.\ \@ref(Interpretation)).

   '*Catalogue of Bias* list over $60$ different ways that studies can be biased,'
} else {
   '[*Catalogue of Bias* list over $60$ different ways that studies can be biased](https://catalogofbias.org/),'
}`
though this book only discusses a small number of possible biases.


## Explanatory variable changes {#FactorYExplanatory}

Changes in the values of the explanatory variable may be associated with changes in the values of the response variable.
However, it may not; after all, determining if a relationship exists between the response and explanatory variables (or the *extent* of this relationship) is the purpose of the study.
If nothing else influenced the values of the response variable, life would be easy:
any change of a given size in the value of the explanatory variable would *always* result in a change of the same size in the value of the response variable.


::: {.example #TypingExplanatory name="Explanatory variable"}
In the typing-speed study (Sect.\ \@ref(Chap6-Intro)), the explanatory variable is the sex of the person.
If nothing else influenced typing speed, all females would record the same typing speed every time, and all males would record the same typing speed every time.
This is clearly unreasonable.
:::


## Importance of identifying extraneous variables {#ExtraneousVariables}

<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-startup-stock-photos-7357.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


Other variables (besides the explanatory variable) almost certainly exist which are associated with changes in the value of the response variable.
These are called *extraneous variables*.


::: {.definition #ExtranaeousVariable name="Extranaeous variable"}
An *extraneous variable* is any variable (potentially) associated with the response variable, but is not the explanatory variable.
:::


::: {.example #Typing2 Extraneousname="Extraneous variables"}
In the typing-speed study (Chap.\ \@ref(Chap6-Intro)), potential extraneous variables may include age, the presence or absence of certain medical conditions, the level of familiarity with computers, whether the person wears glasses, etc.
:::


All extraneous variables are, by definition, potentially related to the response variable.
They may or may not be associated with the explanatory variable as well.
Extraneous variables may have other names too (Table\ \@ref(tab:ClassifyExtraneous)), though these names are used inconsistently.


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-resize-4-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


When an extraneous variable is *also* related to the explanatory variable, the extraneous variable is called a *confounding variable* (or a *confounder*).
A confounding variable can obscure the true relationship between the response and explanatory variables (i.e., confounding variables can [bias](#Bias) the results).


::: {.definition #ConfoundingVariable name="Confounding variable"}
A *confounding variable* (or a *confounder*) is an extraneous variable associated with the response *and* explanatory variables (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:InfluencesConfounding), left panel).
:::


::: {.definition #Confounding name="Confounding"}
*Confounding* is when a third variable influences the observed relationship between the response and explanatory variable.
:::


A relationship between the response and explanatory variables may be apparent, but only because *both* of these variables are related to the confounding variable (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:InfluencesConfounding)).


::: {.example #ConfoundingCigaretteLighters name="Confounding variables"}
People who carry cigarette lighters are more likely to get lung cancer. 
The reason this relationship exists, however, is because of a *confounding variable*: whether or not the person is a smoker.
'Whether or not the person is a smoker' is probably related to *both* the response and explanatory variables:

* A smoker is more likely to carry a cigarette lighter (the explanatory variable) than a non-smoker; and
* A smoker is more likely to develop lung cancer (the response variable) than a non-smoker.
:::


::: {.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
Consider this RQ:

> Among university students, is the percentage of females who know their own blood pressure the same as the percentage of males who know their own blood pressure?

For this RQ, the *explanatory variable* is the sex of person, and the *response variable* is whether a student knows their own blood pressure.
 A potential confounding variable is 'The program of study', since this is (potentially) related to *both* the response and explanatory variables:

* 'Program of study' is related to sex (the explanatory variable): a higher percentage of females study nursing, while a greater percentage of males study engineering (at least, in Australia).
* 'Program of study' is related to knowing your blood pressure (the response variable): nursing students probably practice taking each others blood pressures so probably know theirs, whereas engineering students do not.
:::


Managing confounding is *very* important, as ignoring confounding can completely change the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (see Sect.\ \@ref(KidneyExample)) and hence can compromise internal validity.
Managing confounding is discussed in Sects.\ \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding) and\  \@ref(ObsManagingConfounding).


```{r InfluencesConfounding, fig.cap="Confounding variables (left) are extraneous variables associated with the response and explanatory variables. Lurking variables (right) are associated with the response and explanatory variables, but are not recorded", fig.align="center", fig.height=2.5, fig.width=8.75, out.width='100%'}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

showYInfluences(showChance = FALSE,
                showDesign = FALSE, 
                showExtraneous = FALSE,
                showConfounding = TRUE)

showYInfluences(showChance = FALSE,
                showDesign = FALSE, 
                showExtraneous = FALSE, 
                showLurking = TRUE) 

```


If the values of potential confounding variables are recorded, their impact can be managed.
However, sometimes the values of the confounding variables are not recorded (perhaps due to poor design); then, they are called *lurking variables* (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:InfluencesConfounding), right panel).
Failure to acknowledge lurking variables can lead to wrong conclusions (for example, see Sect.\ \@ref(KidneyExample)).


::: {.definition #LurkingVariable name="Lurking variable"}
A *lurking variable* is an extraneous variable associated with the response *and* explanatory variables (that is, is a *confounding* variable), but whose values *are not* recorded in the study data.
:::


::: {.example #LurkingMoulds name="Lurking variables"}
A study (@joiner1981lurking; @wilson1952eb) examined the strength of plastic parts, to determine if the time in the production mould influenced the strength of the part [@wilson1952eb, p.\ 55--56]:

> Hot plastic was introduced in the mold, pressed for $10$ seconds, and removed. 
> Another batch was then introduced into the same mold, pressed for $20$ seconds, and so on, the time increasing with each batch.

Greater time in the mould (explanatory variable) was found to be associated with greater plastic strength (response variable).
However, mould temperature was a *lurking variable*: it was associated with *both* the response and explanatory variables:

* Higher mould temperatures (the lurking variable) were associated with greater strength (the response variable); and
* Higher mould temperatures (the lurking variable) were experienced by later batches with longer mould times (the explanatory variable), since the mould was hotter for the later batches.

The cause of the greater strength was *not* the time in the mould; it was the higher temperature experienced by the later moulds (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:LurkingExampleMould)).

To clarify the language (Table\ \@ref(tab:ClassifyExtraneous)):

* Extraneous variables are, by definition, always associated with the response variable.
  If they are not recorded, and so the researchers are unaware of them, they become part of 'chance'.
* Extraneous variables are called *confounding variables* if they are also related to the explanatory variable.
* Confounding variables are called *lurking variables*, if they are not recorded.

These terms are not always used consistently by all researchers, but the *ideas* are important nonetheless.


```{r ClassifyExtraneous}
ExtVars <- array( dim = c(2, 3) )
colnames(ExtVars) <- c("Type", 
                       "Associated with response",

To avoid lurking variables, researchers generally collect lots of information about the *individuals in the study* (such as age and sex if the study involves people) and *circumstances of the individuals in the study* (such as the temperature at the time of data collection) that may be relevant, in case they are confounding variables.

Can you think of possible extraneous variables in the letter-typing study (Sect.\ \@ref(Chap6-Intro))?

## Importance of study design {#StudyDesign}

Many aspects of the study *design* can influence the observed relationship between the response and explanatory variable (i.e., can bias the results).
Good design principles can minimise other impacts, so the focus remains on the influence of the explanatory variable on the response variable (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:VariationPartitioned)).

Since many aspects of the study design may be under the control of the researchers, study design is very important for reducing bias and improving internal validity.
The study design principles are discussed at length soon (Chaps.\ \@ref(DesignExperiment) and\ \@ref(DesignObservational)).

<img src="Illustrations/pexels-startup-stock-photos-7357.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example #TypingPoor name="Design"}
The typing-speed study (Sect.\ \@ref(Chap6-Intro)) could be poorly designed. 
Suppose females were *always* asked to use their dominant hand, and males *always* asked to use their non-dominant hand.
Females would probably have a faster average time, simply because they use their dominant hands.
:::


## Chance and variation in the response {#Chance}

*Chance* (or natural) variation refers to variation that cannot otherwise be explained: even repeating a study exactly the same way every time on the same individuals will not always produce the same values of the response variable.

Chance variation makes the influence of the explanatory variable (which we want to study) hard to detect, so minimising chance variation is important (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:VariationPartitioned)).
*Minimising the amount of the chance variation* requires using good design principles, and measuring as many other extraneous variables that may explain variation in the response variable as is reasonable.

Chance can impact the values of the response variable in different ways: 

* Each *individual* can produce different values of the response variable each time the response variable is measured (*within*-individuals variation); and
* Each individual in the study can produce different values of the response variable compared to *other* individuals (*between*-individuals variation):

We need different strategies to understand each of these sources of variation:

* To estimate the amount of variation *within* individuals: many observations are needed from each unit of analysis (individual).
* To estimate amount of variation *between* individuals: many units of analysis (individuals) are needed.

Since *between*-individual variation is usually more variable (i.e., larger variation) than the *within*-individual variation, using *many* individuals is usually more important than using a smaller number of individuals many times each.

`r webexercises::hide()`
1. We would learn a lot about that female... but very little about females in general.
2. We would learn a lot about females in general... but have one measurement from each.
   Since we might expect that the same person might produce similar (not necessarily identical) typing speed, this is not really a problem.
3. We would learn a lot about females in general... and a little about each female too.

## Chapter summary {#Chap6-Summary}

In a research study, the main interest is usually the relationship between a *response variable* and *explanatory variable*.
However the values of the response variable can be influenced by things other than the explanatory variable:
*extraneous variable* (other variables that aren't of primary interest), the *study design*, and  *chance*.

Some extraneous variables are also related to the explanatory variable, and are called *confounding variables* (and are *lurking variables* if not recorded).
If the study design makes it difficult to separate the relationship between the response and explanatory variable from other possible causes, the study has poor *internal validity*.

1. What is the *best* description of the variable 'Ecology type'?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
	"Response variable",
	"Explanatory variable",
	answer = "Confounding variable",
	"Lurking variable"))}`
1. What *type* of study is this?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
	"Experimental, because this is a scientific study involving chemical analysis of water samples",
	"Experimental, because the researchers need to do some laboratory work to determine the arsenic concentrations",
	answer = "Observational, because the researchers do not determine the distance of the lakes from the mine site",
	"Observational, because the researchers are taking observations about the lakes (such as elevation and bedrock type)"

A study examined the relationship between diet quality and depression in Australian adolescents [@jacka2010associations].
The researchers used a sample of $7114$ adolescents aged $10$--$14$ years old, and also measured information about (p.\ 435):

> ...age, gender, socioeconomic status, parental education, parental work status, family conflict, poor family management, dieting behaviours, body mass index, physical activity, and smoking...

1. Identify the response and explanatory variables.
2. Which of the other listed variable reasonably could be considered *extraneous variables*, *confounding variables* and *lurking variables*?

A newspaper article [@data:GreenTeaCutsRiskOfCancer] reported that 'Women who drank green tea at least three times a week were $14$ per cent less likely to develop a cancer of the digestive system'.
However, the final paragraph of the article notes that:
  
> Nobody can say whether green tea itself is the reason, since green tea lovers are often more health-conscious in general.

Identify the explanatory and response variables, and explain that final sentence using language introduced in this chapter.

A study recorded the lung capacity (using Forced Expiratory Volume, or FEV, in litres) of children aged\ $3$ to\ $19$ [@data:Tager:FEV; @BIB:data:FEV], and also recorded whether not the children were smokers.
One finding was that children who smoke have a *larger* average FEV (i.e., larger average lung capacity) than children who do *not* smoke, in general.

Name a confounding variable that may explain this surprising finding.
Would it be likely that this variable is a *lurking* variable?

::: {.exercise #FactorsInfluenceYRTEC}
Consider a study to determine if the percentage of children who consume Ready-To-Eat-Cereals (RTEC) for breakfast is the same for children aged between $5$ and\ $10$, as for children aged between $11$ and\ $15$.
The researchers also measured the age of the child, the number of siblings living with the child, and the sex of the child.

1. Which variables are extraneous variables? \tightlist
   * The sex of the child
`r if( knitr::is_html_output()) {mcq( c(answer = "Yes", "No") )}`
   * The percentage consuming RTEC
`r if( knitr::is_html_output()) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No") )}`
   * Whether or not the child consumes RTEC
`r if( knitr::is_html_output()) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No") )}`
   * The age group of the child
`r if( knitr::is_html_output()) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No") )}`
   * The age of the child
`r if( knitr::is_html_output()) {mcq( c(answer = "Yes", "No") )}`
   * The number of siblings living with the child
`r if( knitr::is_html_output()) {mcq( c(answer = "Yes", "No") )}`


2. Is the variable 'the sex of the child' a lurking variable?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output()) {
longmcq( c(
   "Yes: It is likely to be related to the response variable", 
   "No: It is the explanatory variable",
   answer = "No: It is a variable that is recorded so it can't be a lurking variable",
   "Yes: it is likely to be related to the explanatory variable",
   "Yes: It is likely to be related to the response and explanatory variable") )}`
3. Is it reasonable for the weight of the child to be a lurking variable?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output()) {
longmcq( c(
   "No: it can't be a lurking variable because it is probably not related to all the extraneous variables.", 
   "Yes, because it is related to whether or not the child consumes RTEC.",
   answer = "Yes: It is not measured, and could be related to the age of the child, and whether or not the child consumes RTEC.",
   "No: It can't be a variable because it is not measured.",
   "Yes, because it is probably related to age group of the child.") )}`

**Answers to in-chapter questions:**

- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:LetterTypingSamples}: 1. We would learn a lot about that female... but little about females in general. 2. We would learn a lot about females in general... but have one measurement from each.
   Since we might expect that the same person might produce similar (not necessarily identical) typing speed, this is not really a problem. 3. We would learn a lot about females in general... and a little about each female too.
