::: {.objectivesBox .objectives data-latex="{iconmonstr-target-4-240.png}"}
So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, select a study design, and find a sample to study.

**In this chapter**, you will learn how to ensure that the conclusions are logical and sound.
You will learn to:

* identify issues that might negatively impact internal validity.
* identify issues that might impact the values of the response variables.
* identify extraneous, confounding and lurking variables.

Consider the letter-typing RQ again (from Example \@ref(exm:Typing)):

> For students in this course this semester, is the average number of words typed per minute on a keyboard the same for females and males?

For this study:

* **P**: Students in this course this semester.
* **O**: Average number of letters typed per minute (say, 'typing speed').
* **C**: Between females and males.
* **I**: None. (The values of C cannot be allocated to students).

After measuring the typing speed (the *response variable*) of many individuals, the values collected will vary: It is very unlikely that every student in the study will record the same typing speed.
The measured typing speeds can be influenced by many issues (Fig. \@ref(fig:Influences)):

* *The explanatory variable* (Sect. \@ref(FactorYExplanatory)):
  The values of the explanatory variable may influence the values of the response variable; of course, they may not either. 
  The purpose of the study is to find out...
  In this example, the explanatory variable is the sex of the student.
* *Other variables* (Sect. \@ref(ExtraneousVariables)):
  *Other* variables (apart from the response and explanatory variables) may influence the response variable (perhaps more so than the explanatory variable) such as 'age', or 'whether or not the person wears glasses'. 
  We can work with these other variables if we are careful.
* *Design issues*  (Sect. \@ref(StudyDesign)):
  The way the study is *designed* can also influence the values of the response variable.
  These can mean *disaster* if not handled properly.
* *Chance*, or *randomness* (Sect. \@ref(Chance)):
  The same person doing the same thing repeatedly will not record exactly the same reaction time every attempt.
  This is unavoidable, but having an idea of the size of this variation is useful.


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">

</div>


The purpose of the study is to explore the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variable... but many other issues can obscure that relationship. 
However, an [*internally valid*](#def:InternalValidity) study is one designed to focus on the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variables, eliminating other possibilities (such as *extraneous variables*, *design issues*, and *chance*)


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
One goal of study design is to maximise internal validity: to design a study to isolate the relationship of interest, by eliminating, as well as possible, all other possible explanations.
:::


Internal validity is one of the most important properties of scientific studies, and is important for reasoning about evidence more generally.
Internal validity is the focus of Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) (experimental studies) and \@ref(DesignObservational) (observational studies).


## Bias {#Bias}

*Bias* refers to any misrepresentation that can lead to a false conclusion, and may occur *intentionally* or *unintentionally*. 

::: {.definition #Bias name="Bias"}
*Bias* compromises the results or inferences in a study, which may lead to inaccurate conclusions.
*Bias* can be introduced at any part of the research process, and may occur consciously or unconsciously.
:::

Bias may occur during [data collection](seletion bias; Sect. \@ref(#def:SelectionBias)), analysis, or [interpreting](#Interpretation) and reporting results.
The [*Catalogue of Bias* list over 60 different ways that studies can be biased](https://catalogofbias.org/) though, in this book, only a small number of possible biases are discussed.

## The explanatory variable {#FactorYExplanatory}

Changes in the values of the explanatory variable may be associated with changes in the values of the response variable.
However, it may not; after all, determining this (or the *extent* of this) is the purpose of the study.
If nothing else influenced the values of the response variable, life would be easy:
Any change of a given size in the value of the explanatory variable would *always* results in change of the same size in the value of the response variable.


::: {.example #TypingExplanatory name="Explanatory variable"}
In the typing-speed study (Sect. \@ref(Chap6-Intro)), the explanatory variable is the sex of the person.
If nothing else influenced typing speed, all females would record the same typing speed every time, and all males would record the same typing speed every time.
This is clearly unreasonable.

## Importance of identiying extraneous variables {#ExtraneousVariables}

<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-startup-stock-photos-7357.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


Other variables (besides the explanatory variable) almost certainly exist which are associated with changes in the value of the response variable.
These are called *extraneous variables*.

::: {.definition #ExtranaeousVariable name="Extranaeous variable"}
An *extraneous variable* is any variable that is (potentially) associated with the response variable, but is not the explanatory variable.
:::


::: {.example #Typing2 Extraneousname="Extraneous variables"}
In the typing-speed study (Chap. \@ref(Chap6-Intro)), potential extraneous variables may include age, the presence or absence of certain medical conditions, the level of familiarity with computers, etc.
:::


All extraneous variables are, by definition, potentially related to the response variable.
They may or may not be associated with the explanatory variable as well.
Extraneous variables may have other names too (Table \@ref(tab:ClassifyExtraneous)), though these names are used inconsistently [@dunn2016learning].


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-resize-4-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


When an extraneous variable is *also* related to the explanatory variable, the extraneous variable is called a *confounding variable*.
A confounding variable can obscure the true relationship between the response and explanatory variables (i.e., confounding variables can [bias](#Bias) the results).


::: {.definition #ConfoundingVariable name="Confounding variable"}
A *confounding variable* (or a *confounder*) is an extraneous variable associated with the response *and* explanatory variables (Fig. \@ref(fig:InfluencesConfounding)).
:::


::: {.definition #Confounding name="Confounding"}
*Confounding* is when a third variable influences the observed relationship between the response and explanatory variable.
:::


A relationship between the response and explanatory variables may be apparent, but only because *both* of these variables are related to the confounding variable (Fig. \@ref(fig:InfluencesConfounding)).


::: {.example #ConfoundingCigaretteLighters name="Confounding variables"}
People who carry cigarette lighters are more likely to get lung cancer. 
The only reason that this relationship exists, however, is because of a *confounding variable*: whether or not the person is a smoker.

'Whether or not the person is a smoker' is (potentially) related to *both* the response and explanatory variables:

* A smoker is more likely to carry a cigarette lighter (the explanatory variable) than a non-smoker; and
* A smoker is more likely to develop lung cancer (the response variable) than a non-smoker.
:::


::: {.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
Consider this RQ:

> Among university students, is the percentage of females who know their own blood pressure the same as the percentage of males who know their own blood pressure?

For this RQ, the *explanatory variable* is the sex of person, and the *response variable* is whether a student knows their own blood pressure.
 A potential confounding variable is 'The program of study', since this is (potentially) related to *both* the response and explanatory variables:

* 'Program of study' is related to sex (the explanatory variable): a higher percentage of females study nursing, while a greater percentage of males study engineering.
* 'Program of study' is related to knowing your blood pressure (the response variable): nursing students probably practice taking each others blood pressures so probably know theirs, whereas engineering students do not.
:::


Managing confounding is *very* important, as confounding can completely change the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (see Sect. \@ref(PercentagesKStones)) and hence can compromise internal validity.
Managing confounding is discussed in Sects. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding) and  \@ref(ObsManagingConfounding).

If confounding variables are measured, assessed, described or recorded, their impact can be managed.
However, sometimes confounding variables are not measured, assessed, described or recorded, and they are then called *lurking variables* (Fig. \@ref(fig:InfluencesLurking)).
Failure to acknowledge lurking variables can lead to wrong conclusions (for example, see Sect. \@ref(PercentagesKStones)).


::: {.definition #LurkingVariable name="Lurking variable"}
A *lurking variable* is an extraneous variable associated with the response *and* explanatory variables (that is, is a *confounding* variable), but whose values *are not* measured, assessed, described or recorded in the study.

::: {.example #LurkingCigaretteLightersVariables name="Lurking variables"}
Consider studying the relationship between carrying cigarette lighters, and developing lung cancer (Example \@ref(exm:ConfoundingCigaretteLighters)).
We could define:

* the **response** variable as "whether or not a person gets lung cancer"; and
* the **explanatory** variable as "whether or not a person carries a cigarette lighter".

Now consider the variable "whether or not a person is a smoker", which is likely to be related to both the response and explanatory variables (Example \@ref(exm:ConfoundingCigaretteLighters)).
If that information *was recorded* by the researchers, it would be called a **confounding** variable.
In contrast, if it *was not recorded* by the researchers, it would be called a **lurking variable** (Fig. \@ref(fig:LurkingExampleSmoking)).

Now consider the variable "whether or not the person worked closely with someone who smoked".
This variable is possibly associated with the response variable: someone who works closely with a smoker may be slightly more likely to get lung cancer ('passive smoking') than someone who does not [@taylor2001passive].
However, it is very unlikely to be associated with owning a cigarette lighter (whether or not someone owns a cigarette lighter probably doesn't depend on whether or not they work closely with a smoker).

Hence, if that information *was* recorded, it would be an **extraneous** variable (but not a confounding variable).
If that variable *was not* recorded, the variation it produces in the response variable would just end up as part of the chance variation.

To clarify (Table \@ref(tab:ClassifyExtraneous)):

* All extraneous variables are related to the response variable, by definition.
* Some extraneous variables are also called *confounding variables*, if they are also related to the explanatory variable.
* Some confounding variables are also called *lurking variables*, if they are not measured, assessed, described or recorded.

Unknown extraneous variables become part of variation due to chance (i.e., unexplained).
These terms are not always used consistently by all researchers [@flanagan2005confound], but the ideas are important nonetheless.

To avoid lurking variables, researchers generally collect lots of information about the *individuals in the study* (such as age and sex if the study involves people) and *circumstances of the individuals in the study* (such as the temperature at the time of data collection) that may be relevant, in case they are confounding variables.

Can you think of any other possible extraneous variables in the letter-typing study (Sect. \@ref(Chap6-Intro))?
:::


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
Consider a study to determine if the percentage of children who consume Ready-To-Eat-Cereals (RTEC) for breakfast is the same for children aged between 5 and 10, and children aged between 11 and 15.
The researchers also measured the age of the child, the number of siblings living with the child, and the sex of the child.

1. Which variables are extraneous variables?
   * The sex of the child
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")) {mcq( c(answer = "Yes", "No") )}`
   * The percentage consuming RTEC
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No") )}`
   * Whether or not the child consumes RTEC
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No") )}`
   * The age group of the child
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No") )}`
   * The age of the child
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")) {mcq( c(answer = "Yes", "No") )}`
   * The number of siblings living with the child
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")) {mcq( c(answer = "Yes", "No") )}`


2. Is the variable "the sex of the child" a lurking variable?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")) {
longmcq( c(
   "Yes: It is likely to be related to the response variable", 
   "No: It is the explanatory variable",
   answer = "No: It is a variable that is recorded so it can't be a lurking variable",
   "Yes: it is likely to be related to the explanatory variable",
   "Yes: It is likely to be related to the response and explanatory variable") )}`
3. Is it reasonable for the weight of the child to be a lurking variable?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")) {
longmcq( c(
   "No: it can't be a lurking variable because it is probably not related to all the extraneous variables.", 
   "Yes, because it is related to whether or not the child consumes RTEC.",
   answer = "Yes: It is not measured, and could be related to the age of the child, and whether or not the child consumes RTEC.",

## Importance of study design {#StudyDesign}

Many aspects of the study *design* can influence the observed relationship between the response and explanatory variable (i.e., can bias the results).
Good design principles can minimise the impact, so the focus remains on the influence of the explanatory variable on the response variable.

Since many aspects of the study design may be under the control of the researchers, study design is very importance for reducing bias and improving internal validity.
The study design principles are discussed at length soon (Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) and \@ref(DesignObservational)).

::: {.example #TypingPoor name="Design"}
The typing-speed study (Sect. \@ref(Chap6-Intro)) could be poorly designed. 
Suppose females were *always* asked to use their dominant hand, and males *always* asked to use their non-dominant hand.
Females would probably have a faster average time, simply because they use their dominant hands.
:::


## Chance and variation in the response {#Chance}

*Natural* (chance) variation refers to variation that cannot otherwise be explained: even repeating a study exactly the same way every time on the same individuals will not always produce the same values of the response variable.
This is called *natural variation*, *chance variation*, or just *chance*.

Natural variation makes the influence of the explanatory variable (which we want to study) hard to detect, so minimising chance variation is important.
*Minimising the amount of the chance variation* requires using good design principles, and measuring as many other extraneous variables that may explain variation in the response variable as is reasonable.

Chance can impact the values of the response variable in different ways: 

* Each *individual* can produce different values of the response variable each time the response variable is measured (*within*-individuals variation); and
* Each individual in the study can produce different values of the response variable compared to *other* individuals (*between*-individuals variation):

We need different strategies to understand each of these sources of variation:

* To estimate the amount of variation *within* individuals: Many observations are needed from each unit of analysis (individual).
* To estimate amount of variation *between* individuals: Many units of analysis (individuals) are needed.

Since *between*-individual variation is usually more variable (i.e., larger variation) than the *within*-individual variation, using *many* individuals is usually more important than using a smaller number of individuals many times each.

Consider the letter-typing study (Sect. \@ref(Chap6-Intro)) again.
What are the advantages and disadvantage of measuring the typing speed for:

1. one female 30 times?
2. 30 different females once each?
3. 10 different females, three times each?

`r webexercises::hide()`

1. We would learn a lot about that female... but very little about females in general.
2. We would learn a lot about females in general... but have one measurement from each.
   Since we might expect that the same person might produce similar (not necessarily identical) reaction times, this is not really a problem.
3. We would learn a lot about females in general... and a little about each female too.

## Summary {#Chap6-Summary}

In a research study, we usually explore relationships between a **response variable** and **explanatory variable**.
However the values of the response variable can be influenced by things other than the explanatory variable:

* Other variables that aren't of primary interest (**extraneous variable**);
* The **study design**, and
* **Chance**.

Some extraneous variables are also related to the explanatory variable, and are called **confounding variables** (and are **lurking variables** if they are not measured, assessed, described or recorded).
If the study design makes it difficult to separate the relationship between the response and explanatory variable from other possible causes, the study has poor **internal validity**.


## Quick review questions {#Chap6-QuickReview}

The *Giant Mine* in Yellowknife, Canada, ceased operation in 1999 after operating for 50 years, during which 237,000 tonnes of arsenic trioxide was released.

One study [@houben2016factors] examined the arsenic concentration in lake water from 25 lakes within a 25km radius of the mine (11 years after the mine closed), to determine if the arsenic concentration was related to the distance of the lake from the mine.
They also recorded:

* the type of bedrock (volcanic; sedimentary; grandiorite);
* the ecology type (lowland; upland);
* the elevation of the lake (in metres);
* the lake area (in hectares); and
* the catchment area (in hectares).

Use this information to answer the following.

1. What is the *response* variable?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	answer = "Arsenic concentration",
	"Distance of the lake from the mine",
	"Type of bedrock",
	"Ecology type",
	"Elevation",
	"Lake area",
	"Catchment area"))}`
1. What is the *explanatory* variable?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	"Arsenic concentration",
	answer = "Distance of the lake from the mine",
	"Type of bedrock",
	"Ecology type",
	"Elevation",
	"Lake area",
	"Catchment area"))}`
1. Is the variable "Catchment area" likely to be a *lurking* variable?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	"No: It is not related to the response variable",
	answer = "No: It is measured and recorded, so cannot be a lurking variable",
	"Yes: It may be related to the response and explanatory variables",
	"Yes: It may be related to the response variable"))}`
1. Is the variable "Type of bedrock" likely to be a *confounding* variable?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	"No: It is not related to the response variable",
	"No: It is measured and recorded, so cannot be a confounding variable",
	answer = "Yes: It may be related to the response and explanatory variables",
	"Yes: It may be related to the response variable"))}`
1. What is the *best* description of the variable "Ecology type"?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	"Response variable",
	"Explanatory variable",
	answer = "Confounding variable",
	"Lurking variable"))}`
1. What *type* of study is this?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
	"Experimental, because this is a scientific study involving chemical analysis of water samples",
	"Experimental, because the researchers need to do some laboratory work to determine the arsenic concentrations",
	answer = "Observational, because the researchers do not determine the distance of the lakes from the mine site",
	"Observational, because the researchers are taking observations about the lakes (such as elevation and bedrock type)"
))}`


1. Which of the following can be used to manage confounding in experiments?
   * Blinding the individuals
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No"))}` 
   * Using a control group
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No"))}` 
   * Using special methods of analysis
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c(answer = "Yes", "No"))}` 
   * Randomly allocating treatments to groups
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c(answer = "Yes", "No"))}` 
   * Blinding the researchers
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No"))}` 

1. Which of the following statements are true?

   * Experimental studies must use random samples.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No"))}` 
   * An experimental study must blind the researchers.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No"))}` 
   * An experimental study must blind the participants.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No"))}` 
   * Experimental studies must use a control group.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c("Yes", answer = "No"))}` 
   * In experimental studies, the treatments must be allocated by the researchers.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c(answer = "Yes", "No"))}`

              answer = "A group receiving a pill that looks just like Treatment A and B, but has no effective ingredient"))}`

2. In the study, the patients did not know which treatment they received.

3. What is the purpose of blinding the participants?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
   longmcq( c("To ensure that researchers did not unintentionally influence the results",
              answer = "To ensure that participants did not change their behaviour because of the treatment they were receiving",
              "To manage confounding"))}`

A study recorded the lung capacity (using Forced Expiratory Volume, or FEV, in litres) of children aged 3 to 19 [@data:Tager:FEV; @BIB:data:FEV], and also recorded whether not the children were smokers.
One finding from the data [@mypapers:dunnsmyth:glms] is that children who smoke have a *larger* average FEV (i.e. larger average lung capacity) than children who do *not* smoke.

Name a confounding variable that may explain this surprising finding.
