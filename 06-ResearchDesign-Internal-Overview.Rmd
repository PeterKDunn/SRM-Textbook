```{block2, type="rmdobjectives"}
So far,
you have learnt to
ask a RQ, 
identify different ways of obtaining data,
and design the study.

**In this chapter**,
you will learn how to ensure that the conclusions we can make are logical and sound.
You will learn to:

* identify issues that might negatively impact internal validity.
* identify issues that might impact the values of the response variables.
* identify extraneous, confounding and lurking variables.

Consider the letter-typing RQ again (from Example \@ref(exm:Typing)),
where this RQ was posed:

> For students in this course this semester,
> is the average number of letters typed on a keyboard in 10 seconds
> the same for females and males?

For this study:

* **P**: Students in this course this semester.
* **O**: Average number of letters typed in 10 seconds (say, 'typing speed').
* **C**: Between females and males.
* **I**: None. (The values of C cannot be allocated to students).

After measuring the typing speed
(the *response variable*) of many individuals,
a lot of variation will be observed in the values collected:
Every student in the study is likely to have a different typing speed.

The measured typing speeds 
can be influenced by many issues
(Fig. \@ref(fig:Influences)):

* *The explanatory variable* (Sect. \@ref(FactorYExplanatory)):
  The values of the explanatory variable may influence the values of the response variable;
  of course, they may not either. 
  The purpose of the study is to find out...
  In this example, the explanatory variable is the sex of the student.
* *Other variables* (Sect. \@ref(ExtraneousVariables)):
  *Other* variables that aren't the focus of the study may influence the response variable,
  such as 'age' or 'whether or not the person wears glasses'. 
  We can work with these other variables if we are careful.
* *Design issues*  (Sect. \@ref(StudyDesign)):
  The way in which the study is *designed* can also influence the values of the response variable.
  These can mean *disaster* if not handled properly.
* *Chance*, or *randomness* (Sect. \@ref(Chance)):
  Even the same person doing the same thing repeatedly will not record exactly the same
  reaction time every attempt.
  This influence is unavoidable,
  but we can live with it if we have some idea of the how large this variation is.

An [internally-valid](#def:InternalValidity) study is one where 
the association between the
outcome and the comparison/connection can be attributed to that comparison/connection,
rather than to other factors. 

That is,
an internally-valid study is one where 
the impacts of other possible explanations for that association
(such as *extraneous variables*,
*design issues*,
and *chance*)
have been accounted for, minimised, or are well-managed.

```{block2, type="rmdimportant"}
The goal of study design is to design a study to isolate the relationship of interest, 
by eliminating, as well as possible, all other possible explanations.
```

This is hugely important, and is the main focus of 
Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) (experimental studies)
and \@ref(DesignObservational) (observational studies).


```{definition, Bias, name="Bias"}
*Bias* compromises the results or inferences in a study, which may lead to inaccurate conclusions.

*Bias* can be introduced at any part of the research process,
and may occur consciously or unconsciously.
```

We have already met one type of bias:
[selection bias](def:SelectionBias).

## The explanatory variable and variation in the response {#FactorYExplanatory}

The explanatory variable may be associated with changes in the
values of the response variable.
However, it may not;
after all,
determining this is the purpose of the study.

If nothing else influenced the values of the response variable,
life would be easy:
Any change of a given size in the value of the explanatory variable
would *always* results in change of the same size
in the value of the response variable.


```{example TypingExplanatory, name="Explanatory variable"}
In the typing-speed study (Example \@ref(exm:Typing)),
the explanatory variable is the sex of the person.
If nothing else influenced typing speed,
all females would record the same typing speed every time,
and
all males would record the same typing speed every time.
This is clearly unreasonable.
```

Other variables probably exist which are associated with 
changes in the value of the response variable;
these are called *extraneous variables*.

```{definition, ExtranaeousVariable, name="Extranaeous variable"}
An *extraneous variable*\index{extraneous variable}
is any variable that is (potentially) associated with the response variable,
but is not the explanatory variable.
```

```{example Typing2, Extraneousname="Extraneous variables"}
In the typing-speed study (Example \@ref(exm:Typing)),
potential extraneous variables may include 
age, the presence or absence of certain medical conditions, 
the level of familiarity with computers, etc.
```


All extraneous variables are, 
by definition, 
related to the response variable.
An extraneous variable may or may not be associated with the explanatory variable as well.
Extraneous variables may have other names too
(Table \@ref(tab:ClassifyExtraneous)),
though these names are used inconsistently by researchers
[@dunn2016learning].

```{definition, ConfoundingVariable, name="Confounding variable"}
A *confounding variable*\index{confounding variable}
(or a *confounder*)\index{confounder}
is an extraneous variable associated with the response *and* explanatory variables
(Fig. \@ref(fig:InfluencesConfounding)).
```


```{definition, Confounding, name="Confounding"}
*Confounding*\index{confounding}
is when a third variable influences the relationship between the response
and explanatory variable.
```

The problem with confounding is a relationship between
the response and explanatory variables may be evident,
but only because *both* of these variables are related to the confounding variable
(Fig. \@ref(fig:InfluencesConfounding)).


```{example ConfoundingCigaretteLighters, name="Confounding variables"}
A relationship exists between carrying cigarette lighters,
and lung cancer:
people who carry cigarette lighters are more likely to get lung cancer. 

The only reason that this relationship exists is because of a 
*confounding variable*:
whether or not the person is a smoker.
A smoker is more likely to carry a cigarette lighter,
and is also more likely to develop lung cancer.
```


Managing confounding is *very* important,
as confounding can completely change the relationship between the response and explanatory variables
(see the example in Sect. \@ref(PercentagesKStones))
and hence can compromise internal validity.

Ways of managing confounding are discussed in
Sects. \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding) and 
\@ref(ObsManagingConfounding).

Sometimes confounding variables
are not measured, assessed, described or recorded;
these confounding variables are then called *lurking variables*
(Fig. \@ref(fig:InfluencesLurking)).
Failure to acknowledge lurking variables can lead to wrong conclusions
(for example,
see Sect. \@ref(PercentagesKStones)).


```{definition, LurkingVariable, name="Lurking variable"}

```{example LurkingCigaretteLightersVariables, name="Lurking variables"}
Consider the relationship between carrying cigarette lighters,
and developing lung cancer
(Example \@ref(exm:ConfoundingCigaretteLighters)).

In this study, we could define:

* the **response** variable as "whether or not a person gets lung cancer"; and
* the **explanatory** variable as "whether or not a person carries a cigarette lighter".

Now consider the variable "whether or not a person is a smoker".
This variable is associated with the response variable
(people who smoke are more likely to get lung cancer than those who do not smoke)
and with the explanatory variable
(people who smoke are more likely to carry a cigarete lighter than those who do not smoke).

Hence, if that information *was* recorded by the researchers, 
it would be called a **confounding** variable.

In contrast, if it was *not recorded* by the researchers,
it would be called a **lurking variable**
(Fig. \@ref(fig:LurkingExampleSmoking)).

Now consider the variable "whether or not the person worked closely with someone who smoked".
This variable is possibly associated with the response variable 
(someone who works closely with a smoker would be slightly more likely to get lung cancer ('passive smoking')
than someone who does not [@taylor2001passive]),
but is very unlikely to be associated with owning a cigarette lighter
(whether or not someone owns a cigarette lighter probably doesn't depend on whether or not they work closely with a smoker).

Hence, if that information *was* recorded, it would be an **extraneous** variable (but not a confounding variable).

If that variable *was not* recorded, the variation it produces in the response variable
would just end up as part of the chance variation.

To clarify (Table \@ref(tab:ClassifyExtraneous)):

* Extraneous variables are all related to the response variable, by definition.
* Some extraneous variables are also called *confounding variables*:
  if they are also related to the explanatory variable.
* Some confounding variables are also called *lurking variables*:
  if they are not measured, assessed, described or recorded.

Some unknown extraneous variables will be associated with the response variable only,
and so become part of variation due to chance (i.e., unexplained).
These terms are not always used consistently by all researchers [@flanagan2005confound].


	
```{r echo=FALSE, ClassifyExtraneous}
ExtVars <- array( dim=c(2, 3) )
colnames(ExtVars) <- c("Type", "Associated with response", "Associated with response and explanatory")
ExtVars[1, ] <- c("Measured or observed", "No special name: extraneous", "Confounding (not lurking)")

        longtable = FALSE,
        booktabs = TRUE,
        escape = FALSE, # For latex to work in \rightarrow

        longtable = FALSE,
        caption = "The relationship between the population and the individuals",
        booktabs = TRUE)    
}
```


To avoid lurking variables,
researchers generally collect lots of information 
about the *individuals in the study* 
(such as age and sex if the study involves people)
and *circumstances of the study* (such as the temperature)
that may be relevant,
in case they are confounding variables.


```{example LurkingParamedics, name="Lurking variables"}
Consider the relationship between the number of fatalities in an incident,
and number of paramedics sent to the incident.
'Severity of the incident' is the lurking variable,
since more severe accidents would have 
more paramedics attending (in general),
and also have more fatalities (in general).
```


```{lemma ExtraeousVars, name="Extraneous variables"}
Can you think of any other possible extraneous variables
in the letter-typing study (Example \@ref(exm:Typing))?

## Study design and variation in the response {#StudyDesign}

Many aspects of the study design can influence the value of the response variable.
Good design principles can be used to minimise 
the impact of these as much as possible,
so the focus is on the influence of the
explanatory variable on the response.

The study design principles are discussed at length soon
(Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) and \@ref(DesignObservational)).

```{example TypingPoor, name="Design"}
The typing-speed study (Example \@ref(exm:Typing))
could be poorly designed. 

For example,
if females were *always* asked to use their dominant hand,
and males *always* asked to use their non-dominant hand,
the comparison would not be equivalent for females and males.

Females would probably have a faster average time,
simply because they are using their dominant hands.
```







## Chance and variation in the response {#Chance}

*Natural* (chance) variation refers to variation that
cannot otherwise be explained:
even repeating a study exactly the same way every time 
will not always produce the same values of the response variable.
This is called *natural variation*, *chance variation*, or just *chance*.

Natural variation makes 
the influence of the explanatory variable
(which we are wanting to  study)
hard to detect,
so minimizing chance variation is important.
*Minimise the amount of the chance variation*, 
requires using good design principles,
and measuring as many other extraneous variables
that may explain variation in the response variable
as is reasonable.

Chance can impact the values of the response variable in different ways:
each *individual* can produce different values of the response variable 
each time the individual repeats the study
(*within*-individuals variation);
each individual in the study can produce different values of the 
response variable compared to *other* individuals
(*between*-individuals variation):

* To estimate the amount of variation *within* individuals:
 	Many observations are needed from each unit of analysis (individual).
* To estimate amount of variation *between* individuals
 	Many units of analysis (individuals) are needed.

Since *between*-individual variation is usually more variable than the 
*within*-individual variation,
using *many* individuals
is usually more important than 
using a smaller number of individuals many times.





```{lemma ChanceTyping, name="Chance"}
Consider the letter-typing study (Example \@ref(exm:Typing)) again.
What are the advantages and disadvantage of:

* measuring one female 30 times?
* measuring 30 different females once each?
* measuring 10 different females three times each?

```
  



## Summary {#Chap6-Summary}

In a research study,
we are usually exploring relationships between a response variable and explanatory variable.
However the values of the response variable
can be influenced by things other than the explanatory variable,
such as other variables that aren't really of interest (**extraneous variable**), the **study design** and by **chance**.
Some extraneous variables are also related to the explanatory variable, and are called **confounding variables** (and are **lurking variables** if they cannot be measured, assessed, described or recorded).






## Quick review questions {#Chap6-QuickReview}

The Giant Mine in Yellowknife, Canada,
ceased operation in 1999 after operating for 50 years,
during which
237,000 tonnes of arsenic trioxide was released.

One study 
[@houben2016factors]
examined the
arsenic concentration in lake water
from 25 lakes within a 25km radius of the mine
(11 years after the mine closed),
to determine if the arsenic concentration 
was related to the distance of the lake from the mine.

They also recorded the type of bedrock
(volcanic; sedimentary; grandiorite),
the ecology type 
(lowland; upland),
the elevation of the lake (in metres),
the lake area (in hectares),
and the catchment area (in hectares).

1. What is the *response* variable?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	answer = "Arsenic concentration",
	"Distance of the lake from the mine",
	"Type of bedrock",
	"Ecology type",
	"Elevation",
	"Lake area",
	"Catchment area"))}`
1. What is the *explanatory* variable?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	"Arsenic concentration",
	answer = "Distance of the lake from the mine",
	"Type of bedrock",
	"Ecology type",
	"Elevation",
	"Lake area",
	"Catchment area"))}`
1. Is the variable "Catchment area" likely to be a *lurking* variable?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	"No: It is not related to the response variable",
	answer = "No: It is measured and recorded, so cannot be a lurking variable",
	"Yes: It may be related to the response and explanatory variables",
	"Yes: It may be related to the response variable"))}`
1. Is the variable "Type of bedrock" likely to be a *confounding* variable?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	"No: It is not related to the response variable",
	"No: It is measured and recorded, so cannot be a confounding variable",
	answer = "Yes: It may be related to the response and explanatory variables",
	"Yes: It may be related to the response variable"))}`
1. What is the *best* description of the variable "Ecology type"?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	"Response variable",
	"Explanatory variable",
	answer = "Confounding variable",
	"Lurking variable"))}`
1. What *type* of study is this?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
	"Experimental, because this is a scientific study involving chemical analysis of water samples",
	"Experimental, because the researchers need to do some laboratory work to determine the arsenic concentrations",
	answer = "Observational, because the researchers do not determine the distance of the lakes from the mine site",
	"Observational, because the researchers are taking observations about the lakes (such as elevation and bedrock type)"
))}`

A study examined the relationship between diet quality and depression in Australian adolescents
[@jacka2010associations].
The researchers used a sample of 7114 adolescents aged 10--14 years old in their study,
and also measured information about:

> ...age, gender, socioeconomic status, parental education, 
> parental work status, family conflict, poor family management, dieting behaviours, 
> body mass index, physical activity, and smoking...
>

After identifying the response and explanatory variables,
which of these listed variable reasonably could be considered 
*extraneous variables*, *confounding variables* and *lurking variables*?
```





```{exercise FactorsInfluenceYStudy2}

A newspaper article
[@data:GreenTeaCutsRiskOfCancer]
reported on a study that found

> Women who drank green tea at least three times a week 
> were 14 per cent less likely to develop a cancer of the digestive system.

However,
the final paragraph of the article notes that:
  
> Nobody can say whether green tea itself is the reason, 
> since green tea lovers are often more health-conscious in general.

Identify the explanatory and response variables,
and explain that final sentence using terms introduced in this chapter.

```{exercise FactorsInfluenceYStudy3}

A study recorded the lung capacity 
(measured as Forced Expiratory Volume, or FEV, in litres)
of children aged 3 to 19
[@data:Tager:FEV; @BIB:data:FEV],
and also recorded whether not the children were smokers.
One finding from the data 
[@mypapers:dunnsmyth:glms]
is that children who smoke have a *larger* average FEV (i.e. larger average lung capacity) than
children who do *not* smoke.

Name a confounding variable that may explain this surprising finding.
Would it be likely that this variable is a lurking variable?
