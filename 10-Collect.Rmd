# Procedures for collecting data {#CollectingDataProcedures}



::: {.objectivesBox .objectives data-latex="{iconmonstr-target-4-240.png}"}
So far,
you have learnt to
ask a RQ, 
identify different ways of obtaining data, 
and design the study.

**In this chapter**,
you will learn how to collect the data
needed to answer the RQ.
You will learn to:

* record the important steps in data collection.
* describe study protocols.
* ask survey questions.
* describe the basic differences between online and paper surveys.

## Protocols

If the RQ is well-constructed,
all terms are clearly defined,
and the research design is clear and well explained,
then collecting the data should be reasonably easy to implement.
However,
data collection may be time-consuming, tedious and expensive
so getting the data collection correct first time is important.

*Before* collecting the data,
a plan should be established and documented that explains exactly 
how the data will be obtained;
Unforeseen complications are not unusual,
so often a *pilot study* 
(or a *practice run*)
is conducted before the real data collection takes place,
to see if the planned procedure is practical and optimal.
This plan is a draft **protocol**.


::: {.definition #Protocol name="Protocol"}
A *protocol*
is a procedure documenting the details of the design and implementation of studies,
and for data collection. 
:::


A pilot study allows the researcher to:

* Determine the feasibility of the data collection protocol.
* Identify unforeseen challenges.
* Obtain data that might help with sample size calculations.
* Potentially save time and money.

</div>



::: {.definition #PilotStudy name="Pilot study"}
A *pilot study* is
a small test run of the study protocol,
used to check that the protocol seems appropriate and practical,
and to identify possible problems with the design or protocol.
:::


After the pilot study,
the planned protocol may need to be refined.
Once the protocol has been finalised,
then the data can be collected.

Protocols ensure repeatability of the study 
(to ensure successful replication of results by others)
to enable others to confirm or compare results,
and others can understand exactly what was done, and how:

> ...scientific reports must describe experiments in sufficient detail to allow other researchers to reproduce them.
>
> @mendes2018reproducible (p. 3081)

Protocols should clearly indicate how design aspects 
(such as blinding the individuals, random allocation of treatments, etc.)
will happen.
This final record is the final **protocol**.
Someone else should be able to read the protocol
and approximately repeat the study
(this is part of ethical research practice: Sect. \@ref(Ethics)).
Diagrams can be useful to aid explanations.
All studies should have a well-established protocol
for describing how the study was done.


::: {.example #ProtocolEG name="Protocol"}
A study [@data:Wojcik:ForwardFall] examined the forward-leaning angle 
from which people could recover and not fall,
to determine if this angle was different (on average) for younger and older people.

The paper goes into great detail to explain the protocol 
(almost 1.5 pages,
plus a diagram).
:::


::: {.example #ProtocolEG2 name="Protocol"}
Consider this partial protocol, 
which shows ethics and honesty in describing a protocol:
  
> Fresh cow dung was obtained from free-ranging, grass fed, and antibiotic-free 
> Milking Shorthorn cows (*Bos taurus*) in the Tilden Regional Park in Berkeley, CA. 
> Resting cows were approached with caution and startled by loud shouting, 
> whereupon the cows rapidly stood up, defecated, and moved away from the source of the annoyance. 
> Dung was collected in ZipLoc bags (1 gallon), snap-frozen and stored at $-80$ C. 
>
> --- @hare2008sepsid, p. 10

:::


```{block2, type="exampleExtra"}
A study [@data:Stensballe2005:Catheter] examined three different types of male catheters,
to compare 'withdrawal friction force'.
The paper goes into great detail to explain the protocols
(almost a whole page, 
plus a (painful-looking) diagram).

In addition,
the exclusion criterion\index{exclusion criteria}
are given as:

> Subjects with experience of recurrent urinary tract infections, 
>	known congenital urogenital abnormalities or known urethral strictures 
>	were excluded from participation.
>
> ---  @data:Stensballe2005:Catheter, p. 979

```


One approach to documenting the data collection process is to use 
the [STAR method](https://www.cell.com/star-methods):

* S (**Structured**): 
	The protocol is organised logically, with attention to detail.
* T (**Transparent**): 
	All the necessary information is provided: 
	the protocol is transparent, comprehensive and accurate.
* A (**Accessible**): 
	The protocol is easy to access, 
	easy to follow, and easy to comprehend.
* R (**Reporting**):  
	The protocol is reported in whole and in detail, 
	so it could be replicated.





## Collecting data using surveys

Data may be collected in many ways
(laboratory experiments, taking measurements, field observations, etc.).
For both observational and experimental studies,
though,
collecting data using surveys is common.
Surveys are very difficult to do well:
question wording is crucial, 
and surprisingly difficult to get right
[@fink1995survey].

Questions in a survey may be *open-ended* 
(respondents can write their own answers)
or *closed*
(respondents select from a small number of possible answers, as in multiple-choice questions).
Both open and closed questions have advantages and disadvantages.
Answers to open questions usually lend themselves to qualitative analysis.

This section only briefly examines surveys:

* [Asking survey questions](#AskSurveyQuestions); and
* [Comparing online and paper surveys](#OnlinePaperSurveys).




### Asking survey questions {#AskSurveyQuestions}

Many issues must be kept in mind when framing survey questions;
here are some.

* **Avoid leading questions** which may indicate how respondents are expected to answer.
  Question wording is the usual reason for leading questions.
* **Avoid ambiguity**:
  Avoid terms that may be unfamiliar,
  and questions that are unclear.
* **Avoid asking the uninformed**,
  and avoid asking respondents about issues they don't know about
  (for example,
  people will even give directions to places that do not even exist [@collett1976pointing]).
  Many people will tend to give a response even if they do not understand,
  but such responses are worthless.
* **Avoid complex and double-barrelled questions**;
  these are often hard to understand.
* **Avoid problems with confidentiality**, 
  which would be considered unethical.
  Ethics committees usually look very carefully for questions that are unethical.
  In special cases and with justification,
  ethics committees may allow such questions. 
* **Ensure** that questions and clearly and precisely worded.
* **Ensure** that options for multiple-choice questions are *mutually exclusive* (all answers fit into only one category) and *exhaustive* (the categories cover *all* possible options).



::: {.example #LeadingQns name="Leading question"}
This survey question is a *leading question*,
because the expected response is obvious:
  
> Because bottles from bottled water create enormous amounts of non-biodegradable landfill
> and hence pose a threat to sensitive native wildlife,
> do you support a ban on bottled water in Australia?

:::


::: {.example #QuestionWording name="Question wording"}
Question wording can be important.
These two questions would produce different percentages of respondents agreeing:

* Which is easier to *buy*: cigarettes, beer or marijuana?
* Which is easier to *obtain*: cigarettes, beer or marijuana?

:::


::: {.example #LeadingQuestion2 name="Leading question"}
Consider this survey question:

> Do you like this new orthotic?

Although not obvious,
this question may incite respondents to please,
since *liking* is the only option presented.
Better would be to ask:

> Do you like or dislike this new orthotic?
  
Even better (but more difficult to implement) is to ask 
the second question above,
but randomly chose the order of the 'like' and 'dislike';
that is,
ask some respondents if they
'like or dislike' the new orthotic,
and others if they 'dislike or like' the new orthotic.
:::


::: {.example #AmbiguousQns name="Ambiguous question"}
Consider this survey question:

> Do children run faster now?

This question is ambiguous: Faster now compared to *what* or *when*?
:::


::: {.example #UninformedQns name="Asking the uninformed"}
Consider this survey question:

> Is the use of fibre composites for waterside recreational purposes
> likely to cause the material to swell?

Only people involved in the industry are likely to be able to properly answer this question.
Nonethless, many people will still give an opinion, even if they are uninformed.
This data will be effectively useless (response bias), 
but the researcher may not realise this.
:::


::: {.example #UnclearQns name="Unclear wording"}
Consider this survey question:

> I don't go out of my way to purchase low-fat food unless they are also
> low in calories but not necessarily salt.  Do you agree?

It is not clear what a 'yes' answer means.
:::


::: {.example #DoubleBarrelledQns name="Double-barrelled question"}
Consider this survey question:

> Do you jog and swim for exercise?

This question would be better asked as two separate questions:
one asking about jogging, and one about swimming.
:::


::: {.example #ConfidentialityQns name="Confidentiality"}
Consider this survey question:

> Do you have a water tank that has been installed illegally, without council permission?

Respondents are unlikely to admit to breaking rules.
:::


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
Consider this survey question:

> Consider this book that you are currently reading. 
> How useful do you think this book would be for students and young professionals in the field?
  
What is the biggest problem with this survey question?

(Answer is here^[There are two questions; it is *double-barrelled*. Better is to ask the two questions separately, one about *students* and one about *young professionals*. This allows us to separate the two components of the original survey question.].)
:::


::: {.example #MutuallyExclusiveQns name="Mutually exclusive options"}
Consider this survey question
(from @chan2008exploration):
 
> Approximately how much time do you spend on attending to patient's medications at the event of a non-critical case?
> (Includes writing down a medication list, searching for medications)

The options are:

* 0--5 minutes
* 5--10 minutes
* More than 10 minutes

This is a poor question, because a respondent does not know which option to select for an answer of "5 minutes".

### Online and paper surveys {#OnlinePaperSurveys}

Surveys may be conducted using paper-based surveys,
or online surveys;
both have advantages and disadvantages [@porter2004pros].

**Paper-based surveys** 
require the survey information to be manually entered 
into the computer for later analysis, 
which is time consuming and expensive,
and prone to data-entry errors.

Paper-based surveys can also be costly to prepare, 
especially if physical mailing and photocopying is necessary.
However,
people may be more likely to complete paper-based surveys
if they are presented with a survey face-to-face and 
someone waits to collect the completed survey.

**Online surveys** make data collection easier and data entry easier:
data are entered directly onto a computer.
This means less manual handling and less chance of data entry errors.
Online surveys are also easier to share with a
geographically-diverse group of people 
(for example, through email or social media),
but only if the relevant contact details are available.

However,
online surveys may have a lower response rate,
as respondents may be reluctant to click on links in emails 
(especially from unknown sources),
may ignore emails,
or the emails may be flagged a spam.




## Summary {#Chap10-Summary}

Having a detailed procedure for collecting the data
(the **protocol**) is important.
Using a **pilot study** to trial the protocol is often a good idea.
Sometimes,
data can be collected using surveys,
either on **paper** or **online**.
However,
creating good survey questions is far more difficult than it looks...






## Quick review questions {#Chap10-QuickReview}


<!-- bromodosis: smelly feet -->
1. What is the biggest problem with this survey question:
'Do you have bromodosis?' (Possible answers are: Yes/No)
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
                     "It is double-barrelled",
                     "It is a leading question",
                     answer = "It uses language that may not be understood",
                     "It is ambiguous") )}`

1. What is the biggest problem with this survey question:
Do you spend too much time connected to the internet? (Possible answers are: Yes/No)
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
                     "It is double-barrelled",
                     "It is a leading question",
                     "It uses language that may not be understood",
                     answer = "It is ambiguous") )}`
1. What is the biggest problem with this survey question:
'Do you eat fruits and vegetables?'
(Possible answers are: Yes/No)
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
                     answer = "It is double-barrelled",
                     "It is a leading question",
                     "It uses language that may not be understood",
                     "It is ambiguous") )}`

`r webexercises::hide()`
1. **Language**: Do you know what What 'bromodosis'? Most people do not. So how can they answer the question truthfully?
1. **Ambiguous**: 'Too much', compared to what?
1. **Double-barrelled**: Some people may eat fruits but not vegetables for example.
`r webexercises::unhide()`

**Progress:** `r webexercises::total_correct()`
