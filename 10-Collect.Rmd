## Protocols

If the RQ is well-constructed, terms are clearly defined, and the research design is clear and well explained, then collecting the data should be reasonably easy to implement.
However, data collection is often time-consuming, tedious and expensive, so collecting the data correctly first time is important.

*Before* collecting the data, a plan should be established and documented that explains exactly how the data will be obtained, which will include *operational definitions* (Sect. \@ref(OperationDefinitions)).
This plan is called a **protocol**.
Unforeseen complications are not unusual, so often a *pilot study* (or a *practice run*) is conducted before the real data collection, to see if the planned procedure is practical and optimal.
The pilot study may suggest changes to the protocol.


::: {.definition #Protocol name="Protocol"}
A *protocol* is a procedure documenting the details of the design and implementation of studies, and for data collection. 
:::


::: {.definition #PilotStudy name="Pilot study"}
A *pilot study* is a small test run of the study protocol used to check that the protocol seems appropriate and practical, and to identify possible problems with the design or protocol.
:::


A pilot study allows the researcher to:

* Determine the feasibility of the data collection protocol.
* Identify unforeseen challenges.
* Obtain data to determine appropriate sample sizes (Sect. \@ref(EstimatingSampleSize)).
* Potentially save time and money.

<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-task-1-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


After the pilot study, the planned protocol may need to be refined.
Once the protocol has been finalised, the data can be collected.
Protocols ensure studies can be repeated (Sect. \@ref(ReproducibleResearch)) so others can confirm or compare results, and others can understand exactly what was done, and how.
Protocols should clearly indicate how design aspects (such as blinding the individuals, random allocation of treatments, etc.) will happen.

The final **protocol**,without pedantic detail, should appear in the final report.
Someone else should be able to read the protocol and approximately repeat the study (this is ethical: Sect. \@ref(Ethics)).
Diagrams can be useful to support explanations.
All studies should have a well-established protocol for describing how the study was done.

A protocol usually has at least three specific components:

1. How are the individuals chosen from the population (the external validity); and
2. How is the information collected from the individuals (the internal validity); and
3. The analyses, and how they were performed (e.g., what software and the version).



::: {.example #ProtocolEG name="Protocol"}
A study [@data:Wojcik:ForwardFall] examined the forward-leaning angle from which people could recover and not fall, to determine if this angle was different (on average) for younger and older people.
The paper goes into great detail to explain the protocol (almost 1.5 pages, plus a diagram).
:::


::: {.example #ProtocolEG2 name="Protocol"}
Consider this partial protocol, which shows honesty in describing a protocol:
  
> Fresh cow dung was obtained from free-ranging, grass fed, and antibiotic-free Milking Shorthorn cows (*Bos taurus*) in the Tilden Regional Park in Berkeley, CA. 
> Resting cows were approached with caution and startled by loud shouting, whereupon the cows rapidly stood up, defecated, and moved away from the source of the annoyance. 
> Dung was collected in ZipLoc bags (1 gallon), snap-frozen and stored at $-80$ C. 
>

:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
A study [@data:Stensballe2005:Catheter] examined three different types of male catheters, to compare 'withdrawal friction force'.
The paper goes into great detail to explain the protocols (almost a whole page, plus a (painful-looking) diagram).
:::


:::{.example #ProtocolExample name="Protocol"}
In a study to increase the nutritional value of cookies, chocolate bar cookies were created using pureed green peas in place of margarine as a fat-ingredient.
The researchers wanted to assess the acceptance of these cookies to college students.

The article described how the individuals were chosen:

> One hundred and three untrained volunteers were recruited through advertisement across campus from students attending a university in the southeastern United States.
>
> --- @data:Romanchik2018:cookies, p. 4

That is, the sample was a voluntary response sample from a single university.
However, these students probably would have a similar opinion of cookies made with pureed green peas than students elsewhere, so the sample *may* be somewhat representative.
However, the researchers report that the 'consumer panel consisted of women (80.6%) and men (19.4%)' (p. 4).
That is, the sample has a higher percentage of women that in the general population, or the college population. 
(Other extraneous variables were also recorded.)

Exclusion criteria were also applied:

> Any panelist with an allergy or sensitivity to an ingredient used in the preparation of the cookies was excluded from the study. (p. 5)

To obtain the data from the individuals:

> During the testing session, panelists were seated at individual tables. 
> Each cookie was presented one at a time on a disposable white plate. 
> Samples were previously coded and randomized. 
> The presentation order for all samples was 25%, 0%, 50%, 100% and 75% substitution of fat with puree of canned green peas. 
> To maintain standard procedures for sensory analysis [...], panelists cleansed their palates between cookie samples with distilled water (25^$\circ$^C). 
> Similarly, to be consistent with other studies of consumer acceptability of food products, a 9-point hedonic scale in which 9 = like extremely, 5 = neutral, and 1 = dislike extremely, was used to analyze characteristics of color, smell, moistness, flavor, aftertaste, and overall acceptability, for each sample of cookie (p. 5)

In this description, internal validity is managed using random allocation, blinding the individuals, and washouts.

Details are also given of how the cookies were prepared, and how objective measurements (such as moisture content) were determined.
The statistical methods were listed, and the software used was "InStat Instant Biostatistics" (p. 6), though the version was not provided.

<!-- One approach to documenting the data collection process is to use the [STAR method](https://www.cell.com/star-methods): -->

<!-- * S (**Structured**):  -->
<!--   The protocol is organised logically, with attention to detail. -->
<!-- * T (**Transparent**):  -->
<!--   All the necessary information is provided: the protocol is transparent, comprehensive and accurate. -->
<!-- * A (**Accessible**):  -->
<!--   The protocol is easy to access, easy to follow, and easy to comprehend. -->
<!-- * R (**Reporting**): -->
<!--   The protocol is reported in whole and in detail, so it could be replicated. -->


## Collecting data using questionnaires

Data may be collected in many ways (laboratory experiments, field observations, etc.).
For both observational and experimental studies, though, collecting data using *questionnaires* is common.
Questionnaires are very difficult to do well: question wording is crucial, and surprisingly difficult to get right [@fink1995survey].
Pilot testing is crucial!


:::{.definition #Questionnaire name="Questionnaire"}
A questionnaire is a set of questions for respondents to answer.
:::


Questions in a questionnaire may be *open-ended* (respondents can write their own answers) or *closed* (respondents select from a small number of possible answers, as in multiple-choice questions).
Open and closed questions both have advantages and disadvantages.
Answers to open questions usually lend themselves to qualitative analysis.

This section only briefly examines questionnaires:

* Asking questions (Sect. \@ref(AskSurveyQuestions)); and
* Comparing online and paper questionnaires (Sect. \@ref(OnlinePaperSurveys)).


::: {.example #OpenClosedQuestions name="Open and closed questions"}
In a study of German students understanding of microplastics [@raab2021conceptions], students were asked a series of questions, including:

1. Name sources of microplastics in the household.
2. In which ecosystems are microplastics in Germany? Tick the answer (multiple ticks are possible).
   *Options*: (a) sea; (b) rivers; (c) lakes; (d) groundwater.
3. Assess the potential danger posed by microplastics.
   *Options*: (a) very dangerous; (b) dangerous; (c) hardly dangerous; (d) not dangerous.

The first question is an *open question*, where respondents could provide any answers they wished.
The second question is a *closed question*, where multiple option can be selected.
The third question is a *closed question*, where only one option could be selected
:::


### Asking questions {#AskSurveyQuestions}

Some of the issues to keep in mind when framing questionnaire questions are:

* **Avoid leading questions** which may indicate how respondents are expected to answer.
  Question wording is the usual reason for leading questions.
* **Avoid ambiguity**:
  Avoid terms that may be unfamiliar, and questions that are unclear.
* **Avoid asking the uninformed**, and avoid asking respondents about issues they don't know about.
  Many people will tend to give a response even if they do not understand, but such responses are worthless.
  (For example, people may give directions to places that do not even exist [@collett1976pointing]).
* **Avoid complex and double-barrelled questions**; these are often hard to understand.
* **Avoid problems with confidentiality**, which would be considered unethical.
  Ethics committees usually look very carefully for questions that are unethical.
  In special cases and with justification, ethics committees may allow such questions. 
* **Ensure** that questions are clearly and precisely worded.
* **Ensure** that options for multiple-choice questions are *mutually exclusive* (all answers fit into only one category) and *exhaustive* (the categories cover *all* possible options).


::: {.example #LeadingQns name="Leading question"}
This question is a *leading question*, because the expected response is obvious:
  
> Because bottles from bottled water create enormous amounts of non-biodegradable landfill and hence pose a threat to sensitive native wildlife, do you support a ban on bottled water in Australia?
:::


::: {.example #QuestionWording name="Question wording"}
Question wording can be important.
These two questions would produce different percentages of respondents that agree:

* Which is easier to *buy*: cigarettes, beer or marijuana?
* Which is easier to *obtain*: cigarettes, beer or marijuana?
:::


::: {.example #LeadingQuestion2 name="Leading question"}
Consider this question:

> Do you like this new orthotic?

Although not obvious, this question may incite respondents to please, since *liking* is the only option presented.
Better would be to ask:

> Do you like or dislike this new orthotic?
  
Even better (but more difficult to implement) is to ask the second question above, but randomly chose the order of the 'like' and 'dislike'; that is, ask some respondents if they 'like or dislike' the new orthotic, and others if they 'dislike or like' the new orthotic.
:::


::: {.example #AmbiguousQns name="Ambiguous question"}
Consider this question:

> Do children run faster now?

This question is ambiguous: Faster now compared to *what* or *when*?
:::


::: {.example #UninformedQns name="Asking the uninformed"}
Consider this question:

> Is the use of fibre composites for waterside recreational purposes likely to cause the material to swell, and hence discourage you from using the facilities?

Only people involved in the industry are likely to be able to properly answer this question.
Nonetheless, many people will still give an opinion, even if they are uninformed.
This data will be effectively useless, but the researcher may not realise this.
:::


::: {.example #UnclearQns name="Unclear wording"}
Consider this question:

> I don't go out of my way to purchase low-fat food unless they are also low in calories but not necessarily salt.  Do you agree or disagree?

It is not clear what a 'yes' answer means.
:::


::: {.example #DoubleBarrelledQns name="Double-barrelled question"}
Consider this question:

> Do you jog and swim for exercise?

This question would be better asked as two separate questions: one asking about jogging, and one about swimming.
:::


::: {.example #ConfidentialityQns name="Confidentiality"}
Consider this question:

> Do you have a water tank installed illegally, without council permission?

Respondents are unlikely to admit to breaking rules.
:::



::: {.example #MutuallyExclusiveQns name="Mutually exclusive options"}
In a study to determine the time doctors spent on patients (from @chan2008exploration), doctors were given the options:

* 0--5 minutes
* 5--10 minutes
* More than 10 minutes

This is a poor question, because a respondent does not know which option to select for an answer of "5 minutes".
The options are not *mutually exclusive*.

### Online and paper questionnaires {#OnlinePaperSurveys}

Questionnaires may be paper-based or online; both have advantages and disadvantages [@porter2004pros].

**Paper-based questionnaires** require the information to be manually entered into a computer for later analysis, which is time consuming and expensive, and prone to data-entry errors.

Paper-based questionnaires can also be costly to prepare, especially if physical mailing and photocopying is necessary.
However, people may be more likely to complete paper-based questionnaires if they are presented with a questionnaire face-to-face and someone waits to collect the completed questionnaire.

**Online questionnaires** make data collection and data entry easier: data are entered directly onto a computer.
This means less manual handling and less chance of data entry errors.
Online questionnaires are also easier to share with a geographically-diverse group of people (for example, through email or social media), but only if the relevant contact details are available.

However, online questionnaires may have a lower response rate, as respondents may be reluctant to click on links in emails (especially from unknown sources), may ignore emails, or the emails may be flagged a spam.


## Biases{}

The use of surveys is common to obtain information from people, but not without difficulties:

* Response bias (Sect. \@ref(SelectionBias)):
  People do not always answer truthfully;
  sometimes this is unintentional (because of poor questions) or due to embarrassment, boredom or because questions are controversial.
* Non-response bias (Sect. \@ref(SelectionBias)):
  The people who *do not* respond to the survey may be different than those who *do* respond. 
* Ecological validity (Sect. \@ref(InterpretApplicability)): 
  What people *say* may not correspond with what people *do*.


## Summary {#Chap10-Summary}

Having a detailed procedure for collecting the data (the **protocol**) is important.
Using a **pilot study** to trial the protocol an often reveal unexpected changes necessary for a good protocol.

Sometimes, data can be collected using questionnaires, either on **paper** or **online**.
However, creating good questionnaires questions is difficult.
