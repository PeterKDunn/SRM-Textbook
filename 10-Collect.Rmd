## Protocols {#Protocols}\index{Protocols}\index{Data collection}

If the RQ is well-constructed, terms are clearly defined, and the study is well designed and explained, then the process for collecting the data should be easy to describe.
Data collection is often time-consuming, tedious and expensive, so collecting the data correctly first time is important.

*Before* collecting the data, a plan should be established and documented that explains exactly *how* the data will be obtained, which will include *operational definitions* (Sect. \@ref(OperationDefinitions)).\index{Definitions!operational}
This plan is called a *protocol*.


::: {.definition #Protocol name="Protocol"}
A *protocol* is a procedure documenting the details of the design and implementation of studies, and for data collection. 
:::


Unforeseen complications are not unusual, so often a *pilot study* (or a *practice run*) is conducted before the real data collection, to identify problems with the study design or data collection, or ways to improve the study design or data collection.\index{Pilot study}
The pilot study may suggest changes to the protocol.
(Pilot studies may also be useful for determining the size of the sample; see Sect.\ \@ref(SampleSizeOneMean).)


::: {.definition #PilotStudy name="Pilot study"}
A *pilot study* is a small test run of the study protocol used to check that the protocol is appropriate and practical, and to identify (and hence fix) possible problems with the study design or protocol.
:::


A pilot study allows the researcher to:

* determine the feasibility of the data collection protocol.
* identify unforeseen challenges.
* obtain data to determine appropriate sample sizes (Sect. \@ref(EstimatingSampleSize)).
* potentially save time and money.

<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-task-1-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


The data can be collected once the protocol has been finalised.
Protocols ensure studies are repeatable (Sect. \@ref(ReproducibleResearch))\index{Research!reproducibilty} so others can confirm or compare results, and others can understand exactly what was done, and how.
Protocols should indicate how design aspects (such as blinding the individuals, random allocation of treatments, etc.) will happen.\index{Study design}
The final *protocol*, without pedantic detail, should be reported.
Diagrams can be useful to support explanations.
All studies should have a well-established protocol for describing how the study was done.

A protocol usually has at least three components that describe:

1. How individuals are chosen from the population (i.e., external validity); and
2. How information is collected from the individuals (i.e., internal validity); and
3. The analyses, and what software (and version) was used.



:::{.example #ProtocolExample name="Protocol"}
To increase the nutritional value of cookies, researchers made cookies using pureed green peas in place of margarine [@data:Romanchik2018:cookies].
The researchers wanted to assess the acceptance of these cookies to college students.

The protocol discussed *how the individuals were chosen* (p.\ 4):

> ...through advertisement across campus from students attending a university in the southeastern United States.

This voluntary sample comprised $80.6$% women, a higher percentage of women than in the general population, or the college population. 
(Other extraneous variables were also recorded.)

Exclusion criteria were also applied, excluding people "with an allergy or sensitivity to an ingredient used in the preparation of the cookies" (p.\ 5).
The researchers also described *how the data was obtained from the individuals* (p.\ 5):

> During the testing session, panelists were seated at individual tables. 
> Each cookie was presented one at a time on a disposable white plate. 
> Samples were previously coded and randomized. 
> The presentation order for all samples was $25$%, $0$%, $50$%, $100$% and $75$% substitution of fat with puree of canned green peas. 
> To maintain standard procedures for sensory analysis [...], panelists cleansed their palates between cookie samples with distilled water ($25^\circ$C) [...]
> characteristics of color, smell, moistness, flavor, aftertaste, and overall acceptability, for each sample of cookies [was recorded]...

Thus, internal validity was managed using random allocation, blinding individuals, and washouts.
Details are also given of how the cookies were prepared, and how objective measurements (such as moisture content) were determined.

The *analyses and software used* were also given.

Consider this partial protocol, which shows honesty in describing a protocol:
  
> Fresh cow dung was obtained from free-ranging, grass fed, and antibiotic-free Milking Shorthorn cows (*Bos taurus*) in the Tilden Regional Park in Berkeley, CA. 
> Resting cows were approached with caution and startled by loud shouting, whereupon the cows rapidly stood up, defecated, and moved away from the source of the annoyance. 
> Dung was collected in ZipLoc bags ($1$ gallon), snap-frozen and stored at $-80$\ C.

<!-- One approach to documenting the data collection process is to use the [STAR method](https://www.cell.com/star-methods): -->

<!-- * S (**Structured**):  -->
<!--   The protocol is organised logically, with attention to detail. -->
<!-- * T (**Transparent**):  -->
<!--   All the necessary information is provided: the protocol is transparent, comprehensive and accurate. -->
<!-- * A (**Accessible**):  -->
<!--   The protocol is easy to access, easy to follow, and easy to comprehend. -->
<!-- * R (**Reporting**): -->
<!--   The protocol is reported in whole and in detail, so it could be replicated. -->


## Collecting data using questionnaires {#AskSurveyQuestions}

### Writing questions 

Collecting data using *questionnaires* is common for both observational and experimental studies.
Questionnaires are very difficult to do well: question wording is crucial, and surprisingly difficult to get right [@fink1995survey].
Pilot testing questionnaires is crucial!


:::{.definition #Questionnaire name="Questionnaire"}
A questionnaire is a set of questions for respondents to answer.
:::


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
A *questionnaire* is a set of question to obtain information from individuals.
A *survey* is an entire methodology, that includes gathering data using a questionnaire, finding a sample, and other components.
:::

Questions in a questionnaire may be *open-ended* (respondents can write their own answers) or *closed* (respondents select from a small number of possible answers, as in multiple-choice questions).
Open and closed questions both have advantages and disadvantages.
Answers to open questions more easily lend themselves to qualitative analysis.

This section briefly discusses writing questions (Sect. \@ref(AskSurveyQuestions)).


::: {.example #OpenClosedQuestions name="Open and closed questions"}
German students were asked a series of questions about microplastics [@raab2021conceptions], including:

1. Name sources of microplastics in the household.
2. In which ecosystems are microplastics in Germany? Tick the answer (multiple ticks are possible).
   *Options*: (a)\ sea; (b)\ rivers; (c)\ lakes; (d)\ groundwater.
3. Assess the potential danger posed by microplastics.
   *Options*: (a)\ very dangerous; (b)\ dangerous; (c)\ hardly dangerous; (d)\ not dangerous.

The first question is an *open*: respondents could provide their own answers.
The second question is *closed*, where *multiple* options can be selected.
The third question is *closed*, where only *one* option can be selected
:::


When framing questionnaire questions, remember:

* *Avoid leading questions*, which may lead respondents to answer a certain way.
  Question wording is the usual reason for leading questions.
* *Avoid ambiguity*:
  avoid unfamiliar terms and unclear questions.
* *Avoid asking the uninformed*: avoid asking respondents about issues they don't know about.
  Many people will give a response even if they do not understand (such responses are worthless).
  For example, people may give directions to places that do not even exist [@collett1976pointing].
* *Avoid complex and double-barrelled questions*, which can be hard to understand.
* *Avoid problems with ethics*:
  avoid questions about people breaking laws, or revealing confidential or private information.
  In special cases and with justification, ethics committees may allow such questions. 
* *Ensure clarity* in question wording.
* *Ensure options are mutually exhaustive*, so that answers fit into only one category.
* *Ensure options are exhaustive*, so that the categories cover *all* options.


::: {.example #LeadingQns name="Poor question wording"}
Consider a questionnaire asking these questions:

1. Because bottles from bottled water create enormous amounts of non-biodegradable landfill and hence threaten native wildlife, do you support banning bottled water?
2. Do you drink more water now?
3. Are you more concerned about Coagulase-negative *Staphylococcus* or *Neisseria pharyngis* in bottled water?
4. Do you drink water in plastic and glass bottles?
5. Do you have a water tank installed illegally, without permission?
6. Do you avoid purchasing water in plastic bottles unless it is carbonated, unless the bottles are plastic but not necessarily if the lid is recyclable?

Question\ 1 is leading because the expected response is obvious.

Question\ 2 is *ambiguous*: it is unclear what 'more water now' is being compared to.

Question\ 3 is unlikely to be answerable, as most people will be *uninformed*.
Nonetheless, many people will still give an opinion.
This data will be effectively useless, but the researcher may not realise this.

Question\ 4 is *double-barrelled*, and would be better asked as two separate questions (one asking about plastic bottles, and one about glass bottles).

Question\ 5 is unlikely to be given *ethical approval* or to obtain truthful answers, as respondents are unlikely to admit to breaking rules.

Question\ 6 is *unclear*, since knowing what a *yes* or *no* answer means is confusing.
:::


::: {.example #QuestionWording name="Question wording"}
Question *wording* can be important.
These two questions would produce different answers:

* Which is easier to *buy*: cigarettes, beer or marijuana?
* Which is easier to *obtain*: cigarettes, beer or marijuana?
:::


::: {.example #LeadingQuestion2 name="Leading question"}
Consider this question:

> Do you like this new orthotic?

This question is *leading*, since *liking* is the only option presented.
Better would be:

> Do you like or dislike this new orthotic?
:::


::: {.example #MutuallyExclusiveQns name="Mutually exclusive options"}
In a study to determine the time doctors spent on patients (from @chan2008exploration), doctors were given the options:

* $0$--$5$\ mins;
* $5$--$10$\ mins; or
* more than $10$\ mins.

This is a poor question, because a respondent does not know which option to select for an answer of '$5$\ minutes'.
The options are not *mutually exclusive*.

### Challenges using questionnaires {#Biases}

Using questionnaires presents myriad challenges.

* *Non-response bias* (Sect. \@ref(SelectionBias)):
  Non-response bias is common with questionnaires, as they are often used with voluntary-response samples.
  The people who *do not* respond to the survey may be different than those who *do* respond. 
* *Response bias* (Sect. \@ref(SelectionBias)):
  People do not always answer truthfully; for example, what people *say* may not correspond with what people *do* (Sect. \@ref(InterpretApplicability)).
  Sometimes this is unintentional (e.g., poor questions wording), due to embarrassment or because questions are controversial.
  Sometimes, respondents repeatedly provide the same answer when a series of multichoice questions are presented (perhaps due to boredom).
* *Recall bias*:
  People may not be able to accurately recall past events clearly, or recall when they happened.
* *Question order*: The order of he questions can influence the responses.
* *Interpretation*: Phrases and words such as "Sometimes" and "Somewhat disagree" may means different things to different people.

Many of these can be managed with careful questionnaire design, but discussing the methods are beyond the scope of this book.

## Chapter summary {#Chap10-Summary}

Having a detailed procedure for collecting the data (the *protocol*) is important.
Using a *pilot study* to trial the protocol an often reveal unexpected changes necessary for a good protocol.
Creating good questionnaires questions is difficult, but important.
