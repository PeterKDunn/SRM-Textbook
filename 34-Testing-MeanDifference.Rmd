@lambie2021microbial compared the percentage nitrogen (%N) in soils from irrigated and non-irrigated intensively-grazed pastures.
The researchers *paired* similar irrigated and non-irrigated sites (p. 338):

> The irrigated and non-irrigated pairs within each site were within $100$\ m of each other and were on the same soil, landform and usually the same farm with the same farm management on both treatments.

Pairing (Sect.\ \@ref(PairedIntro)) is a form of blocking (Sect.\ \@ref(ExpManagingConfounding)) and is used to manage confounding.
One RQ in the study was:

> For intensively grazed pastures sites, is there a mean reduction in percentage soil nitrogen (%N) when sites are irrigated, compared to non-irrigated?

The data are shown in
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
    'Table\\ \\@ref(tab:SoilCN).'
} else {
    'the table below.'
}`
The parameter is $\mu_d$, the population mean *reduction* in %N when sites are irrigated, compared to non-irrigated.


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
Explaining *how* the differences are computed is important.  
The differences here are the %N in *non-irrigated* sites minus %N in *irrigated* sites.

The differences could be computed as the %N in *irrigated* sites minus %N in *non-irrigated* sites.
*Either is fine*, as long as you remain consistent throughout.
The meaning of any conclusions will be the same.

## Statistical hypotheses and notation

The RQ asks if the mean %N *reduces* in the *population* when sites are irrigated.
If the differences are defined as the %N for *non-irrigated* sites minus *irrigated* sites, then positive values refer to non-irrigated sites having larger %N than irrigated sites, on average. 
Then, the RQ is asking if the mean difference is zero, or if it is *greater* than zero.
The *parameter* is the *population mean difference*. 
The notation used (recapping Sect.\ \@ref(MeanDiffCI)) is:

* $\mu_d$: the mean *difference* in the *population* (in %N).
* $\bar{d}$: the mean *difference* in the *sample* (in %N).
* $s_d$: the *sample* standard deviation of the *differences* (in %N).
* $n$: the number of *differences*.

The *null* hypothesis is that 'there is *no mean change* in %N, in the population' (Sect.\ \@ref(AboutHypotheses)):

* $H_0$: $\mu_d = 0$.

This hypothesis, which we initially *assume* to be true, postulates that the mean reduction may not be zero in the *sample*, due to sampling variation.

Since the RQ asks specifically if mean %N *decreases*, the alternative hypothesis is *one-tailed* (Sect.\ \@ref(AboutHypotheses)).
According to how the differences have been defined, the alternative hypothesis is:

* $H_1$: $\mu_d > 0$ (i.e., one-tailed).

This hypothesis says that the mean change in the population is *greater than* zero, because of the wording of the RQ, and because of how the differences were defined.
(If the differences were defined in the opposite way---as '%N in *irrigated* sites minus *non-irrigated* sites'--- then the alternative hypothesis would be $\mu_d < 0$, which has the same *meaning*.)


## Tests for the mean difference: $t$-test
\index{Sampling distribution!mean difference}

The *sample* mean %N reduction varies depending on which one of the countless possible samples is randomly obtained, *even if* the mean reduction in the population is zero.
That is, the value of $\bar{d}$ varies across all possible samples even if $\mu_d = 0$.
The value of $\bar{d}$ has a sampling distribution.


::: {.definition #DEFSamplingDistributionMeanDiff name="Sampling distribution of a sample mean difference"}
The *sampling distribution of the sample mean difference* is (when certain conditions are met; Sect.\ \@ref(ValiditySampleMeanDiffTest)) described by

* an approximate normal distribution,
* centred around the sampling mean difference, whose value is $\mu_d$ (from $H_0$),
* with a standard deviation (called the *standard error* of $\bar{d}$) of  
\begin{equation}
   \text{s.e.}(\bar{d}) = \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}},
   (\#eq:StdErrorDifferencesTest)
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of differences, and $s_d$ is the standard deviation of the differences.
:::


The value of the *standard error of the differences* here is  
\[
  \text{s.e.}(\bar{d}) = s_d/\sqrt{n} = 0.0618/\sqrt{28} = 0.0117.
\]
This sampling distribution of $\bar{d}$ is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:PercentageNSamplingDist).

The sample mean difference can be located on the sampling distribution (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:PercentageNSamplingDist)) by computing the $t$-score:\index{Hypothesis testing!mean difference}\index{Test statistic!F@$F$-score}
  
\[
	t
	= \frac{\bar{d} - \mu_{d}}{\text{s.e.}(\bar{d})}
	= \frac{0.0282 - 0}{0.0117} = 2.41,
\]
following the ideas in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:tscore).
Software also displays the $t$-score (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:Nitrogenjamovi)).


A $P$-value determines if the sample data are consistent with the assumption (Table\ \@ref(tab:PvaluesInterpretation)).
Since $t = 2.41$, and since $t$-scores are like $z$-scores, the *one*-tailed $P$-value is smaller $0.025$ (based on the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule).\index{68@$68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule}
Software (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:Nitrogenjamovi)) reports that the *two*-tailed $P$-value is $0.02279$.
Hence, the *one*-tailed $P$-value is $0.02279/2 = 0.0114$.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The jamovi software clarifies *how* the differences have been computed.
At the left of the output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:Nitrogenjamovi)), the order implies the differences are found as `NonirrigatedN` minus `IrrigatedN`, the same as our definition.

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`


## Writing conclusions

The one-tailed $P$-value is $0.0114$, suggesting moderate evidence (Table\ \@ref(tab:PvaluesInterpretation)) to support $H_1$.
A conclusion requires an *answer to the RQ*, a summary of the *evidence* leading to that conclusion, and some *summary statistics*:

> Moderate evidence exists in the sample (paired $t = 2.41$; one-tailed $P = 0.0114$) of a mean reduction in percentage soil N  from non-irrigated to irrigated sites (mean reduction: $0.0282$%; $n = 28$; $95$% CI from $0.0042$% to $0.0522$%).

The CI is found using the process described in Chap.\ \@ref(PairedIntro).
The wording implies the direction of the differences.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Saying 'there is evidence of a difference' is insufficient.
You must state *which* measurement is, on average, higher (that is, what the differences *mean*).
:::


## Statistical validity conditions {#ValiditySampleMeanDiffTest}
\index{Sampling distribution!mean difference}

As with any hypothesis test, these results apply under certain conditions.
For a hypothesis test for the mean of paired data, these conditions are the same as for the CI for the mean difference for paired data (Sect.\ \@ref(ValidityPaired)), and similar to those for one sample mean.

Statistical validity can be assessed using these criteria:

* When $n > 25$, the test is statistically valid provided the distribution of differences is *not* highly skewed.
* When $n \le 25$, the test is statistically valid only if the data come from a *population* of differences with a normal distribution.

The sample size of $25$ is a rough figure; some books give other values (such as $30$).
Data with severe skewness or large outliers may need a larger sample size for the test to be statistically valid.

This condition ensures that the *distribution of the sample mean differences has an approximate normal distribution* (so that, for example, the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule can be used).
Provided $n > 25$, this will be approximately true *even if* the distribution of the differences in the population does not have a normal distribution.

If the statistical validity conditions are not met, other similar options include using a sign test of the differences\index{Sign test} or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test of the differences\index{Wilcoxon signed ranks test} [@conover2003practical], or using resampling methods [@efron2021computer].


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityWeightLossHT name="Statistical validity"}
For the %N data, the sample size is $n = 28$, so the test is statistically valid.
:::



## Example: invasive plants {#PairedInvasivePlantsHT}

(This study was seen in Sect.\ \@ref(PairedInvasivePlantsCI).)
Skypilot is a alpine wildflower native to the Colorado Rocky Mountains (USA).
In recent years, a willow shrub (*Salix*) has been encroaching on skypilot territory and, because willow often flowers early, @kettenbach2017shrub studied whether the willow may 'negatively affect pollination regimes of resident alpine wildflower species' (p.\ 6965).

Data for both species was collected at $n = 25$ different sites, so the data are *paired* by site (Sect.\ \@ref(PairedIntro)).
The data are shown in
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
    'Table\\ \\@ref(tab:FloweringData).'
} else {
    'Sect.\\ \\@ref(PairedInvasivePlantsCI).'
}`
The parameter is $\mu_d$, the population mean *difference* in day of first flowering for skypilot, less the day of first flowering for willow.
A *positive* value for the difference means that the skypilot values are larger, and hence that willow flowered first.
The RQ is:

> In the Colorado Rocky Mountains, is there a mean difference between first-flowering day for the native skypilot and encroaching willow?

The hypotheses are
\[
   \text{$H_0$: $\mu_d = 0$}\quad\text{and}\quad\text{$H_1$: $\mu_d\ne 0$}
\]
where the alternative hypothesis is two-tailed.


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
Explaining *how* the differences are computed is important.
The differences here are skypilot minus willow first-flowering days.

However, the differences could be computed as willow minus skypilot first-flowering days.
*Either is fine*, as long as you remain consistent.
The *meaning* of any conclusions will be the same.

The standard error of the mean difference is $\text{s.e.}(\bar{d}) = 0.9396$ (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:Floweringjamovi) or Table\ \@ref(tab:FloweringSummary)).
The value of the test statistic (i.e., the $t$-score) is
\begin{align*}
  t 
  = \frac{\bar{d} - \mu_d}{\text{s.e.}(\bar{d})}
  = \frac{1.36 - 0}{0.9396} = 1.45,
\end{align*}
as in the output.
This is a relatively small value of $t$, so a large $P$-value is expected using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule.
Indeed, the output shows that $P = 0.161$: there is *no evidence* of a mean difference in first-flowering day (i.e., the sample mean difference could reasonably be explained by sampling variation if $\mu_d = 0$).
We write:

> No evidence exists ($t = 1.45$; two-tailed $P = 0.161$) that the day of first-flowering is different for the encroaching willow and the native skypilot (mean difference: $1.36$ days earlier for willow; $95$% CI from $-0.57$ to $3.30$; $n = 25$).

The test is statistically valid since $n = 25$.


:::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
We *do not* say whether the evidence supports the null hypothesis.
We assume the null hypothesis is true, so we state how strong the evidence is to support the alternative hypothesis.
The current sample presents no evidence to contradict the assumption, but future evidence may emerge.
That is:

> No evidence of a difference *does not* mean evidence of no difference.

## Example: chamomile tea {#ChamomileTea-Paired-HT}

(This study was seen in Sects.\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-Paired-CI) and\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-TwoMeans-CI).)
@rafraf2015effectiveness studied patients with Type\ 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
They randomly allocated $32$ patients into a control group (who drank hot water), and another $32$ patients to receive chamomile tea.
Summary data are shown in Table\ \@ref(tab:TGsummaryTable).

In Sect.\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-Paired-CI), a CI was formed for the mean reduction in total glucose (TG) for the hot water and the tea groups separately.
However, we can also ask about whether the mean differences in TG are non-zero due to sampling variation or not.
The following descriptive RQs can be asked:

> * For patients with T2DM, is there a mean *change* in TG after eight weeks drinking *chamomile tea*?
> * For patients with T2DM, is there a mean *change* in TG after eight weeks drinking *hot water*?

The hypotheses are:

\begin{align*}
  \text{Chamomile tea group}: \qquad & \text{$H_0$: } \mu_d = 0\quad \text{vs}\quad\text{$H_1$: } \mu_d \ne 0;\\
  \text{Hot water group:}.    \qquad & \text{$H_0$: } \mu_d = 0\quad \text{vs}\quad\text{$H_1$: } \mu_d \ne 0.
\end{align*}

For the two groups, the test statistics are (using the standard errors in Sect.\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-Paired-CI)):  
\[
  t_T = \frac{38.62 - 0}{5.37} = 7.19\qquad\text{and}\qquad t_W = \frac{-7.12 - 0}{6.48} = -1.10,
\]
where the subscripts $T$ and $W$ refer to the tea and hot-water groups respectively.
The $t$-score for the tea-drinking group is *huge*, so the two-tailed $P$-value will be *very small* using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, and certainly smaller than $0.001$.
This means that there is evidence that chamomile tea had an impact on the mean change in TG.

In contrast, the $t$-score for the water-drinking group is *small*, so the two-tailed $P$-value will be *large* using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, and certainly larger than $0.10$.
This means there is no evidence that placebo treatment (hot water) had any impact on mean change in TG (as one might expect for a placebo).

We can write:

> There is very strong evidence ($t = 7.19$; two-tailed $P < 0.001$) of a mean change in TG for the chamomile-drinking groups (mean reduction: $38.62$\ mg.dl^$-1$^; $n = 32$; approx. $95$% CI: $27.88$ to $49.36$\ mg.dl^$-1$^), but *no* evidence ($t = -1.10$; two-tailed $P > 0.10$) of a mean change in the hot-water drinking group (mean reduction: $-7.12$\ mg.dl^$-1$^; $n = 32$; approx. $95$% CI: $-20.08$ to $5.84$\ mg.dl^$-1$^).

The sample sizes are larger than $25$, so the results are statistically valid.

The two groups appear to show different mean reductions in TG, depending on which group the subject is in.
This may suggest that chamomile tea reduces TG compared to the control... but perhaps the difference in TG between the hot water and tea groups is simply due to sampling variation.
This is considered in Sect.\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-TwoMeans-HT).

## Chapter summary {#Chap29-Summary}


To test a hypothesis about a population mean difference $\mu_d$:

* Write the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$).
* Initially *assume* the value of $\mu_d$ in the null hypothesis to be true.
* Then, describe the *sampling distribution*, which describes what to *expect*  from the sample mean difference based on this assumption: under certain statistical validity conditions, the sample mean difference varies with:
   *  an approximate normal distribution,
   *  with sampling mean whose value is the value of $\mu_d$ (from $H_0$), and
   *  having a standard deviation of $\displaystyle \text{s.e.}(\bar{d}) =\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}$.
* Compute the value of the *test statistic*:  
\[
   t = \frac{ \bar{d} - \mu}{\text{s.e.}(\bar{d})},
\]
where $\mu_d$ is the hypothesised value given in the null hypothesis.
* The $t$-value is like a $z$-score, and so an approximate *$P$-value* can be estimated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, or found using software.

::: {.exercise #TestPairedMeansTasteOfBrocolli}
(These data were also seen in Exercise\ \@ref(exr:PairedCIExercisesBrocolli).)
People often struggle to eat the recommended intake of vegetables.
@data:Fritts2018:Vegetables explored ways to increase vegetable intake in teens.
Teens rated the taste of raw broccoli, and raw broccoli served with a specially-made dip.

Each teen ($n = 100$) had a *pair* of measurements: the taste rating of the broccoli *with* and *without* dip.
Taste was assessed using a '$100$\ mm visual analog scale', where a *higher* score means a *better* taste.
In summary:

* For raw broccoli, the mean taste rating was $56.0$ (with a standard deviation of $26.6$);
 <!-- %  (SDs); so if $n = 100$ we'd get SE: 2.647 -->
* For raw broccoli served with dip, the mean taste rating was $61.2$ (with a standard deviation of $28.7$).

Because the data are paired, the *differences* are the best way to describe the data.
The mean difference in the ratings was $5.2$, with standard error of $3.06$. 
<!-- (working backwards from the $t$-score). Looks like $n = 101$. -->

Perform a hypothesis test to see if the use of dip increases the mean taste rating.
