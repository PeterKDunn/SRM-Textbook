## Introduction {#Chap9-Intro}

The *type* of study and *how* that study is designed can determine how the results of the study should be interpreted.
Ideally, a study would be perfectly externally and internally valid; in practice this is very difficult to achieve.
Practically *every* study has limitations.
The results of a study should be interpreted in light of these limitations.

Limitations can be discussed through three components:

* **External validity** (the *generalisability* of the study results outside the sample): 
  *Generalisability* of the results (Sect. \@ref(InterpretGeneralisability)) to the intended population.
* **Internal validity** (the *effectiveness* of the study in the sample): 
  Steps taken to maximise the internal validity of the study, and the impacts of these on the interpretation of results (Sect. \@ref(InterpretStudyDesign)).
* **Ecological validity** (the *practicality* of the results to real life): 
   *Practicality* the results in the real world (Sect. \@ref(InterpretApplicability)).

All these issues should be considered when considering the study limitations.

Almost every study has limitations.
*Identifying* these limitation, and *discussing the impact* they have on the interpretation of the study results, is important and ethical.
:::


::: {.example #InterpretationSmoking name="Interpretation"}
Smoking was once promoted as healthy and beneficial: some advertisements used doctors to promote cigarette smoking, and others promoted the benefits of smoking to athletes [@Ingalls:Smoking].
An [advertisement for Camel cigarettes](https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/human-body/the-time-before-cigarettes-were-bad-for-your-health/news-story/7c3e11e6f0dc774eacbafb49f2a09078) claimed that '[More doctors smoke Camels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCMzjJjuxQI) than any other cigarette' based on a survey of 113,597 doctors.
That certainly is a *large* sample... but understanding how the data were collected is important.

In fact, [the company that owned Camel cigarettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Reynolds_Tobacco_Company) conducted the survey (which raises suspicions immediately).
Even worse, [the company](https://rjrt.com/) staff interviewed doctors and asked about their smoking habits *after RJ Reynolds provided free cartons of Camel cigarettes* to the doctors.
No wonder more doctors smoked Camel brand!

Concluding that 'More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette' in light of this may be technically correct, but is *highly* unethical.

## Limitations: External validity {#InterpretGeneralisability}

</div>


External validity refers to the ability to *generalise* the results to other groups in the population apart from the sample studied (Sect. \@ref(InternalExternalValidity)).
For a study to be externally valid, it must first be internally valid.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
External validity refers to how well the sample is likely to represent the *target population* given in the RQ.
If the RQ is 'Among Queenslanders, what proportion own a smart speaker?', then the study is externally valid if the sample is representative of Queenslanders.
The results **do not** have to apply to people in the rest of Australia (though this can be commented on, too).
The intended population, as given in the RQ, is *Queenslanders*.
:::


External validity depends on *how* the sample was obtained.
*Results from random samples are likely to generalise to the population and be externally valid* when appropriately analysed.
(The analyses in this book assume all samples are *simple random samples*.)
Furthermore, *results from approximately representative samples may generalise to the population and be externally valid* if those *in* the study are not obviously different than those *not in* the study.


::: {.example #ExternalNZ name="External validity"}
A New Zealand study [@data:Gammon2012:B12] identified (for well-documented reasons) a particular group to study: 'women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand' (p. 21).
The women in the sample were "women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand", and "recruited using a convenience sample method throughout Auckland" (@data:Gammon2012:B12, p. 21).

The results may not generalise to the *intended* population of 'women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand' because all the women in the sample came from only one city (Auckland), and the sample was not a *random* sample.
The results will not generalise to *all* New Zealand women, but this is *not* a limitation: the target population was only 'women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand'.
The researchers did not intend the results to apply to *all* New Zealand women.
:::


::: {.example #ExternalBiochar name="Using biochar"}
A study of growing ginger using biochar [@farrar2018short] used one farm at Mt Mellum, Australia.
While the results may only generalise to growing ginger at Mt Mellum, the encouraging results suggest that a wider, more general, study of the impact of using biochar to grow ginger would be worthwhile.
In addition, ginger is usually grown is similar types of climates and soils, so the results *may* apply to other ginger farms also.
:::


## Limitations: Internal validity {#InterpretStudyDesign}

Internal validity refers to how reasonable and logical the results from the study are:
the strength of the inferences that can be made from the sample (Sect. \@ref(InternalExternalValidity)).
An internally valid study is *effective* in demonstrating that the conclusions made from the sample cannot be explained any other way.

The type of study impacts internal validity.
Experimental studies, in general, have higher internal validity than observational studies, since more of the study design in under the control of the researchers.
However, experimental studies may suffer from lack of [ecological validity](#InterpretApplicability) (for instance, laboratory experiments conducted under controlled  temperature and humidity) and the influence of the [Hawthorne effect](#HawthorneEffectExperimental) (for instance, ethical requirements may mean individuals are told about the study). 
Sometimes, observational studies can manage these issues better.

Internal validity can be compromised also by how the study was designed; confounding, the carry-over effect, the Hawthorne effect, observer bias, and/or the placebo effect are all relevant.
Consequently, if any of these issues are likely to compromise internal validity, the implications on the interpretation of the results should be discussed.
For example, if the study design implies that the Hawthorne effect may be an issue (since the participants were not blinded), this should be clearly stated, and the conclusion should indicate that the individuals in the study may have behaved differently than usual because (for example) they knew the were in a study. 

The internal validity of **observational studies** is often compromised because confounding can be less effectively managed than for experimental studies.
The internal validity of **experimental studies** involving people is often compromised because people must be informed that they are participating in a study.

::: {.example #InternalHandHygiene name="Internal validity"}
In a study of the hand-hygiene practices of paramedics [@barr2017self], *self*-reported hand-hygiene practices were very different than what was reported by *peers*:
  
> ...social desirability and identity may have led to the intentional misreporting of IPC [infection prevention and control] behaviors in favor of better compliance by the participants.
> Evidence for this is that participants reported much higher levels of compliance for themselves than their colleagues
>
> --- @barr2017self, p. 777.

When participants knew they were being studied, their responses made their own behaviours appear better than their colleagues.
This is a study limitation that was necessary to discuss.

::: {.example #InternalVibration name="Internal validity"}
A study of using 'vibration training' on elderly men listed some limitations of their study:

> The potential for observer bias is also acknowledged, as the researcher was not blinded and had prior knowledge of the research aims, disease status, and intervention. 
> As such, these could all have influenced data recording. 
> The researcher tried to minimize the risk of bias by following a standardized protocol for enrolment. 
> The potential of reporting bias and observer bias could be reduced by implementing blinding in future studies.

A study [@botelho2019effect] examined the food choices made when subjects were asked to shop for ingredients to make a last-minute meal.
Half were told to prepare a 'healthy meal', and the other half told just to prepare a 'meal'.
Part of the Discussion stated:

> Another limitation is that results report findings from a simulated purchase.
> As participants did not have to pay for their selection, actual choices could be different.
> Participants may also have not behaved in their usual manner since they were taking part in a research study, a situation known as the Hawthorne effect.

## Limitations: Ecological validity {#InterpretApplicability}

The *practicality* of the study results in the real world should also be discussed.
This is called *ecological validity*.


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-recycling-9-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #EcologicalValidity name="Ecological validity"}
A study is *ecologically valid* if the study methods, materials and context approximate the real situation being studied.
:::


Studies don't *need* to be ecologically valid to be useful; much can be learnt under special conditions, as long as the potential limitations are understood when applying the results to the real world.
Although ecological validity is not essential for a good study, ecological validity is useful if is possible to achieve.
The ecological validity of experimental studies may be compromised because the experimental conditions are sometimes contrived (and for good reason).

</div>


::: {.example #EcologicalCups name="Ecological validity"}
Consider a study to determine what proportion of people will buy a coffee in a reuseable cup.
People could be *asked* about their *intentions*.
This may not be ecologically valid, as how people *act* may not align with what they *say*, especially when social pressures exist to use reusable cups.

An alternative study could *watch* people buy coffees at various coffee shops, and record what people *do* in practice.
This second study is more likely to be *ecologically valid*, as we are watching real-world behaviour.
:::


:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
A study observed the effect of using high-mounted rear brake lights [@data:Kahgane1998:RearBrakeLights], which are now commonplace.
The American study showed that such lights reduced rear-end collisions by about 50%.
However, after making these lights mandatory, rear-end collisions reduced by only 5%. 
Why?

## Summary {#Chap9-Summary}

The limitations in a study need to be identified, and may be related to:

* *external validity* (generalisability);
* *internal validity* (effectiveness); and/or
* *ecological validity* (practicality).


## Quick review questions {#Chap9-QuickReview}

A study [@bingham2016peer] examined the effect of peer pressure from passengers among teenage male drivers.
The aim was to "test the effects of passenger presence and social influence" (p. 126) of these drivers.
The use of a driving simulator was justified as: 

> ... driving simulation has been shown to be an externally valid predictor of real-world driving
>
> @bingham2016peer, p. 125

Part of the *Discussion* section reads (p. 135):

> ... participants were closely clustered around average rates of resistance to peer influence for this age group [...] so it is unclear to what extent these findings would generalize to participants with weaker resistance to peer influences.

Later, the paper reports (p. 135):

> ... the use of an age-peer [passenger assigned by the researchers] allowed substantial experimental control, it may have provided participants with an artificial experience compared to the influence of actual friends. 

1. The study used $n = 52$ 16- and 17-year-old males in the study.
  Should the *external validity* of the study be criticised for only using teenage *males* in the *sample*, and not teenage females?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
                     "No: Only teenage males are likely to be poor drivers",
                     answer = "No: The target population is only teenage males",
                     "Yes: Not all teenagers are males",
                     "Yes: Females and males should be used in the study") )}`
1. What does the *second last* quotation above mean?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
                     "Confounding is likely to be a problem",
                     "The results may not be not externally valid",
                     answer = "The results may not be internally valid",
                     "The sample is not a random sample") )}`
1. True or false: The Hawthorne effect is likely to be an issue in this study.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( TRUE )}`

---

1. Which of the following are true?

   * When interpreting the results of studies, the steps taken to maximize internal validity should be considered.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( TRUE)} else {"________________"}`
   * If studies are not externally valid, then they are not very useful.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( FALSE)} else {"________________"}`
   * When interpreting the results of studies, the steps taken to maximize external validity do not need to be considered.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( FALSE)} else {"________________"}`
   * When interpreting the results of studies, ecological validity is about the impact of the study on the environment.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( FALSE)} else {"________________"}`

---

When interpreting the results of studies, we consider the practicality (`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c(
                     "internal",
                     "external",
                     answer = "ecological") )} else {"________________"}` validity),  the generalizability 
(`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c(
                     "internal",
                     answer = "external",
                     "ecological") )} else {"________________"}` validity)
and the effectiveness (`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c(
                     answer = "internal",
                     "external",
                     "ecological") )} else {"________________"}` validity).

Internal validity refers to issues such as `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c(
                     answer = "confounding",
                     "sampling") )} else {"________________"}`and the Hawthorne effect.

External validity refers to `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {mcq( c(
                     "confounding",
                     answer = "sampling") )} else {"________________"}` methods.
