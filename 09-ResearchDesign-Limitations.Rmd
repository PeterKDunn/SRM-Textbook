# Identifying study limitations {#Interpretation}


```{block2, type="rmdobjectives"}
So far,
you have learnt to
ask a RQ, 
identify different ways of obtaining data, 
and design the study.

**In this chapter**,
you will learn to identify and describe the limitations of a study.
You will learn to:

* identify when and how study results are internally valid.
* identify when and how study results are externally valid.
* identify when and how study results are ecologically valid.

## Introduction {#Chap9-Intro}

The *type* of study and *how* that study is designed 
can determine how the results of the study should be interpreted.
Ideally,
a study would be perfectly externally and internally valid,
but in practice this is very difficult to achieve.
Practically *every* study has limitations.

The results of a study should be interpreted in light of these limitations:
The results should be discussed in light of what the study actually tells,
and what it doesn't actually tell us.

Limitations can often be discussed through three components:

* **External validity** (the *applicability* of the study results outside the sample): 
	The *generalisability* of the results (Sect. \@ref(InterpretGeneralisability)) to the intended population.
* **Internal validity** (the *effectiveness* of the study in the sample): 
	The steps taken to maximise the internal validity of the study,
  and the impacts of these on the interpretation of results (Sect. \@ref(InterpretStudyDesign)).
* **Ecological validity** (the *practicality* of the results to real life): 
	The *practicality* the results in the real world (Sect. \@ref(InterpretApplicability));
	how the study methods, materials and context
	approximate the real situation being studied.

All these issues should be considered when considering the study limitations.



```{block2, type="rmdimportant"}
Almost every study has limitations.
*Identifying* them,
and *discussing the impact* that they have on the
interpretation of the study results,
is important and ethical.
```





```{example InterpretationSmoking, name="Interpretation"}
Smoking was once considered healthy and beneficial:
some advertisements used doctors to promote cigarette smoking,
and others promoted the benefits of smoking to athletes
[@Ingalls:Smoking].

An [advertisement for Camel cigarettes](https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/human-body/the-time-before-cigarettes-were-bad-for-your-health/news-story/7c3e11e6f0dc774eacbafb49f2a09078) once claimed that
'[More doctors smoke Camels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCMzjJjuxQI) than any other cigarette'
based on a survey of 113 597 doctors.
That certainly is a *large* sample...
but understanding how the data were collected is important.

In fact,
the company that owned Camel cigarettes ([RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Reynolds_Tobacco_Company))
conducted the survey (which raises suspicions immediately).
Even worse,
[RJ Reynolds](https://rjrt.com/) staff interviewed doctors and asked about their smoking habits
*after RJ Reynolds provided free cartons of Camel cigarettes* to the doctors.
No wonder more doctors smoked Camel brand!

Concluding that 
'More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette'
in light of this is highly unethical.

External validity 
refers to the ability to *generalise* the results to other groups 
in the population apart from the sample studied
(Sect. \@ref(InternalExternalValidity)).
For a study to be externally valid,
it must first be internally valid.



```{block2, type="rmdimportant"}
Importantly,
external validity refers to how well the sample is likely to represent the *target population* as given in the RQ.

For example, suppose the RQ is 'Among Queenslanders, what proportion own a smart speaker?'.

The study is externally valid if the sample is representative of Queenslanders,
and hence the results from the sample are likely to apply to Queenslanders as a whole.

The results **do not** have to apply to people in the rest of Australia.
The intended population, as given in the RQ, is *Queenslanders*.
```


External validity refers to the *applicability* or the *generalisability* 
of the results to the *target* (or *intended*) population
(Example \@ref(exm:AirConUse)),
which depends on how the sample was obtained:
*results from random samples are likely to generalise to the population and be externally valid*
when appropriately analysed.
(The analyses in this book assume all samples are *simple random samples*.)
Furthermore,
*results from approximately representative samples 
may generalise to the population and be externally valid*
if those *in* the study 
are not obviously different than those *not in* the study.


```{example ExternalNZ, name="External validity"}
A New Zealand study
[@data:Gammon2012:B12]
identified (for well-documented reasons) a particular group to study: 
'women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand' (p. 21).

The women in the sample came from a study

> ... which investigated the health and lifestyle 
> of women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand. 
> Subjects [...] were recruited using a 
> convenience sample method throughout Auckland, 
> which is New Zealand's largest city, 
> and the city in which most South Asian immigrants settle... 
>
> --- (@data:Gammon2012:B12, p. 21)

The results may not generalise to the *intended* population of 
'women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand' 
because all the women in the sample came from only one city in
New Zealand (Auckland),
and the sample was not a random sample.

The results will not generalise to *all* New Zealand women, 
but this is *not* a limitation:
the target population was only 
'women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand'.
The researchers did not intend 
the results to apply to *all* New Zealnd women.
```


```{example, ExternalBiochar, name = "Using biochar"}
A study of using biochar [@farrar2018short] to grow ginger
only used one farm at Mt Mellum, Australia.

While the results may only apply to growing ginger at Mt Mellum,
the encouraging results suggest that a wider,
more general, study of the impact of using biochar to grow ginger would be worthwhile.

In addition,
ginger is usually grown is similar types of climates and soils,
so the results *may* apply to
other ginger farms also.

Internal validity refers to how reasonable and logical the results 
from the study are:\index{internal validity}
the strength of the inferences that can be made from the sample
(Sect. \@ref(InternalExternalValidity)).
That is,
an internally valid study is *effective* in demonstrating
that the conclusions made from the sample
cannot be explained any other way.

Internal validity can be compromised by 
confounding, 
the carryover effect, 
the Hawthorne effect,
observer bias, 
and/or
the placebo effect.
Consequently,
if any of these issues are likely to compromise internal validity,
the implications on the interpretation of the results should be discussed.

For example,
if the study design implies that the Hawthorne effect is likely
to be an issue (since the participants were not blinded),
this should be clearly stated,
and the conclusion should indicate that the individuals in the study
may have behaved differently than usual because (for example)
they knew the were in a study. 

The internal validity of observational studies 
is often compromised because confounding can be less effectively managed
than for experimental studies.

```{example InternalHandHygiene, name="Internal validity"}
In a study of the hand-hygiene practices of 
paramedics
[@barr2017self],
*self*-reported hand-hygiene practices were very different
than what was reported by *peers*:
  
> ...social desirability and identity may have led to the
> intentional misreporting of

> behaviors in favor of better 
> compliance by the participants.
> Evidence for this is that participants
> reported much higher levels of compliance for themselves 
> than their colleagues
>
> --- @barr2017self, p. 777.

That is,
when participants knew they were being studied,
they may have given responses that made their own 
behaviours appear better than their colleagues.
This is a study limitation that was necessary to discuss.

```{block2, type="exampleExtra"}
A study [@botelho2019effect]
examined the food choices made when subjects were asked to 
shop for ingredients to make a last-minute meal.

Half were told to prepare a 'healthy meal',
and the other half told just to prepare a 'meal'.
Part of the Discission stated:

> Another limitation is that results report findings from a simulated purchase.

## Limitations: Ecological validity {#InterpretApplicability}







The *practicality* of the study results
in the real world should also be discussed.
This is called *ecological validity*.


<!-- Text wrap from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43551312/wrap-text-around-plots-in-markdown -->
<!-- Trick from: https://blog.earo.me/2019/10/26/reduce-frictions-rmd/ -->

include_graphics("Pics/iconmonstr-recycling-9-240.png")
```
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`

```{definition, EcologicalValidity, name="Ecological validity"}
A study is *ecologically valid*\index{ecological validity}
if the study methods, materials and context
approximate the real situation being studied.
```

Studies don't *need* to be ecologically valid to be useful;
much can be learnt under special conditions,
as long as the potential limitations are understood
when applying the results to the real world.
Although ecological validity is not essential for a good study,
ecological validity is useful if it is possible to achieve.

The ecological validity of experimental studies 
may be compromised because the experimental conditions
are sometimes contrived.

```{example EcologicalCups, name="Ecological validity"}
Consider a study to determine how likely it is 
that people will buy a coffee in a reuseable cup.

We could *ask* people about their *intentions*.
This study may not be ecologically valid, 
as how people *act* in the real world may not align with what the *say*,
especially when social pressures exist to use reusable cups.

An alternative study involves *watching* 
people buy coffees at various coffee shops,
and record what people actually *do* in practice.

This second study is more likely to be e*cologically valid*,
as we are watching actual behaviour in the real world.

```{block2, type="exampleExtra"}
A study was completed to observe the effect of using
high-mounted rear brake lights [@data:Kahgane1998:RearBrakeLights],
which are now commonplace.
The American study showed that such lights 
reduced rear-end collisions by about 50%.
However,
after making these lights mandatory, 
rear-end collisions reduced by only 5%. Why?
```





## Summary {#Chap9-Summary}

The limitations in a study need to be identified.
Limitations may be related to
**internal validity** (effectiveness),
**external validity** (generalisability),
or 
**ecological validity** (practicality).








## Quick review questions {#Chap9-QuickReview}

A study
[@bingham2016peer]
examined the effect of peer pressure from passengers
among teenage male drivers; 
the aim was to

> ...experimentally test the effects of passenger presence and social influence [...]
> of male adolescent novices in a simulated driving task.
>
> @bingham2016peer, p. 126

The use of a driving simulator was justified as: 

> ... driving simulation has been shown to be an 
> externally valid predictor of real-world driving
>
> @bingham2016peer, p. 125

The *Discussion* section of the article includes a subsection called
'Strengths and limitations'.
Part of that sub-section reads:

> participants were closely clustered around 
> average rates of resistance to peer influence for this age group [...]
> so it is unclear to what extent these findings would generalize to participants 
> with weaker resistance to peer influences.
>
> @bingham2016peer, p. 135


Later, the paper reports:

> ... the use of an age-peer [passenger assigned by the researchers] 
> allowed substantial experimental control, 
> it may have provided participants with an 
> artificial experience compared to the influence of actual friends. 
>
> @bingham2016peer, p. 135


1. The study used $n=52$ 16- and 17-year-old males in the study.
Should the external validity of the study be criticised for only using teenage *males* in the study,
and not teenage females?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
                     "No: Only teenage males are likely to be poor drivers",
                     answer = "No: The target population is only teenage males",
                     "Yes: Not all teenagers are males",
                     "Yes: Females and males should be used in the study") )}`
1. What does the *second last* quotation above mean?  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
                     "Confounding is likely to be a problem",
                     "The results may not be not externally valid",
                     answer = "The results may not be internally valid",
                     "The sample is not a random sample") )}`
1. True or false: The Hawthorne effect is likely to be an issue in this study.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( TRUE )}`
