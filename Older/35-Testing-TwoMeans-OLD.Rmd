## Introduction: garter snakes {#TwoMeansHT-intro}

Some Mexican garter snakes (*Thamnophis melanogaster*) live in habitats with no crayfish, while some live in habitats with crayfish and hence use crayfish as a food source.
@manjarrez2017morphological were interested in whether the snakes in these two regions were different:

> For female Mexican garter snakes, is the mean snout--vent length (SVL) different for those in regions with crayfish and without crayfish?

Two different groups of snakes are studied, and the data are shown

A numerical summary *must* summarise the difference between the means, as the RQ is about this difference.
Each group can be summarised too.
The information is found using software (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SnakesSummaryTestjamovi)), and can be compiled into a table (Table\ \@ref(tab:SnakesNumericalTest)).
The appropriate summary for graphically summarising the *data* is (for example) a boxplot (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SnakesErrorbar), left panel).
An error bar chart (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SnakesErrorbar), right panel), which compares the *sample means*, should also be produced.

## Statistical hypotheses and notation

Since two groups are being compared, subscripts are used to distinguish between the statistics for the two groups; say, Groups\ $A$ and\ $B$ in general (Table\ \@ref(tab:IndSampleNotationHT)).
Using this notation, the *parameter* in the RQ is the difference between population means: $\mu_A - \mu_B$.
As usual, the population values are unknown, so this is estimated using the statistic $\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B$.


```{r IndSampleNotationHT}
Diff2Notation <- array(dim = c(5, 2))
colnames(Diff2Notation) <- c("Group A", 
                             "Group B")

For the garter-snake data, defined the differences as the mean for females snakes living in non-crayfish regions ($N$), *minus* the mean for female snakes in crayfish regions ($C$): $\mu_N - \mu_C$.
This is the *parameter*.
By this definition, the differences refer to how much larger (on average) the SVL is for snakes living in non-crayfish regions.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Here the difference is computed as the mean SVL for snakes living in non-crayfish regions, *minus* the mean SVL for snakes living in crayfish regions.
Computing the difference in the reverse direction (i.e., crayfish regions, *minus* non-crayfish regions) is also correct.

You need to be clear about how the difference is computed, and be consistent throughout.
The *meaning* of the conclusions will be the same whichever direction is used.
:::


As always, the null hypothesis is the default 'no difference, no change, no relationship' position; any difference between the parameter and statistic is due to sampling variation (Sect.\ \@ref(AboutHypotheses)).
Hence, the null hypothesis is 'no difference' between the population means SVL of the two groups:

* $H_0$: $\mu_N - \mu_C = 0$ (equivalent to $\mu_N = \mu_C$).

From the RQ, the alternative hypothesis is *two*-tailed:

* $H_1$: $\mu_N - \mu_C\ne 0$ (equivalent to $\mu_N \ne \mu_C$).

This hypothesis proposes that any difference between the *sample* means is because a difference really exists between the *population means*. 



## Sampling distribution for $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ {#SamplingDistDiffMeansHT}
\index{Sampling distribution!difference between two means}

The *sample* mean difference between the SVL in the two groups depends on which one of the many possible samples is randomly obtained, *even if* the difference between the means in the population is zero.
The difference between the sample means is $8.394$\ cm... but this difference will vary from sample to sample; that is, *sampling variation* exists.


::: {.definition #DEFSamplingDistributionDiffMeansHT name="Sampling distribution for the difference between two sample means"}
The *sampling distribution of the difference between two sample means* $\bar{x}_A$ and $\bar{x}_B$ is, when the appropriate conditions are met (Sect.\ \@ref(ValidityTwoMeans)), described by:

* an approximate normal distribution,
* centred around a sampling mean whose value is ${\mu_{A}} - {\mu_{B}} = 0$, the difference between the *population* means (from $H_0$),
* with a standard deviation of $\displaystyle\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B)$.

The standard error for the difference between the means is found using  
\[
  \text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) = \sqrt{ \text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_A)^2 + \text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_B)^2},
\]
though this value will often be *given* (e.g., on computer output).
:::


For the SVL data, the sampling variation of $\bar{x}_N - \bar{x}_C$ can be described as having:

* an approximate normal distribution,
* centred around a sampling mean whose value is ${\mu_{N}} - {\mu_{C}} = 0$, the difference between the means (from $H_0$),
* with a standard deviation, called the *standard error for the difference between the means*, of 
\[
   \text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_N - \bar{x}_C) = \sqrt{1.2160^2 + 2.1117^2 } = 2.4368.
\]
   The calculation uses the standard errors from Table\ \@ref(tab:SnakesNumericalTest).
   The answer agrees with the *second row* of the jamovi output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SnakesSummaryTestjamovi)).



::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
jamovi gives results from *two* similar hypothesis tests.
In this book, we will always use the second row of information: the 'Welch's $t$'\index{Welch's test} row in jamovi.

The Welch's test\index{Welch's test} row of information *does not* assume that the population standard deviation are equal.
The first row of information *does* assume the population standard deviation are equal.
In most cases, the information in both rows are similar anyway.
:::



## Computing the value of the test statistic: $t$-scores
\index{Hypothesis testing!difference between two means}

The observed difference between sample means, relative to what was expected, is found by computing the test statistic; in this case, a $t$-score.
The jamovi output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SnakesSummaryTestjamovi)) gives the $t$-score, but the $t$-score can also be computed using the information in Table\ \@ref(tab:SnakesNumericalTest):  
\begin{align*}
   t
  &= 
   \frac{\text{sample statistic} - \text{mean of sampling distribution, from $H_0$}}
        {\text{standard deviation of sampling distribution}}\\[6pt]
   &= 
   \frac{ (\bar{x}_P - \bar{x}_C) - (\mu_P - \mu_C)}
        {\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_P - \bar{x}_C)}
  = \frac{8.39 - 0}{2.4368} = 3.44,
\end{align*}
as in the software output.


## Determining $P$-values

A $P$-value determines if the sample statistic is consistent with the assumption (i.e., $H_0$).
Since the $t$-score is large, the $P$-value will be small using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule (less than $0.003$).
This is confirmed by the software (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SnakesSummaryTestjamovi)): the two-tailed $P$-value is $0.0011$.

A small $P$-value suggests the observations are *inconsistent* with the assumption of no difference (Table\ \@ref(tab:PvaluesInterpretation)), and the difference between the sample means could *not* be reasonably explained by sampling variation.

## Writing conclusions

In conclusion, write:

> Strong evidence exists in the sample (two independent samples $t = 3.445$; two-tailed $P = 0.0011$) that the population mean SVL is different for female snakes living in crayfish regions (mean: $34.17$\ cm; $n = 35$) and non-crayfish regions (mean: $42.57$\ cm; $n = 41$; $95$% CI for the difference: $3.51$ to $13.28$\ cm longer for those in non-crayfish regions).

The conclusion contains an *answer to the RQ*, the *evidence* leading to this conclusion ($t = 3.44$; two-tailed $P = 0.0011$), and *sample summary statistics*, including a CI.


## Statistical validity conditions {#Validity-Test-DiffMeans}
\index{Statistical validity!difference between two means}

As usual, these results apply under certain conditions, which are the same as those for forming a CI for the *difference* between two means.
Statistical validity can be assessed using these criteria:

* When *both* samples have $n \ge 25$, the test is statistically valid provided *neither* distribution is highly skewed.
* When one or both groups have $25$\ or fewer observations, the test is statistically valid only if the *populations* corresponding to both comparison groups have an approximate normal distribution.
  
The sample size of $25$ is a rough figure; some books give other values (such as $30$).
Data with severe skewness or large outliers may need larger sample sizes for the test to be statistically valid.

This condition ensures that the *distribution of the difference between sample means has an approximate normal distribution* (so that, for example, the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule can be used).
The histograms of the *sample data* can be used to determine if normality of the *populations* seems reasonable.

## Example: speed signage {#SpeedSignageHT}

(This study was seen in Sect.\ \@ref(SpeedSignageCI).)
To reduce vehicle speeds on freeway exit ramps, @ma2019impacts studied adding additional signage.
At one site (Ningxuan Freeway), speeds were recorded for $38$ vehicles *before* the extra signage was added, and then for $41$ different vehicles *after* the extra signage was added (data in Sect.\ \@ref(SpeedSignageCI)).
The researchers are hoping the addition of extra signage will *reduce* the mean speed of the vehicles.
The RQ is:

> At this freeway exit, does the mean vehicle speed *reduce* after extra signage is added?


```{r}
data(Speed)

Speed$When <- factor(Speed$When,
                     levels = c("Before", "After"),
                     ordered = TRUE)
Speed2 <- data.frame( Before = Speed$Speed[ Speed$When == "Before" ][1:10],
                      After = Speed$Speed[ Speed$When == "After" ][1:10])
```


The data are *not* paired: different vehicles are measured before and after the extra signage is added.
The data are summarised in Table\ \@ref(tab:SignageSummaryHT).
Notice that  
\[
  \text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_B - \bar{x}_A) 
  = \sqrt{ \text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_B)^2 + \text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_A)^2} 
  = \sqrt{ 2.140^2 + 2.051^2} = 2.964,
\]
as in the table.
A graphical summary of the data is a boxplot (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SignageErrorBar), left panel); an error bar chart compares the means, with a CI for each group (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SignageErrorBar), right panel).

Define $\mu$ as the mean speed (in km.h^$-1$^) on the exit ramp.
Then, the parameter is $\mu_B - \mu_A$, the *reduction* in the population mean speed after signage is added.
The hypotheses are:

* $H_0$: $\mu_B - \mu_A = 0$: there is no change in the population mean speeds.
* $H_1$: $\mu_B - \mu_A > 0$: the population mean speed has *reduced*.

The best estimate of the difference in *population* means is the difference between the *sample* means: $(\bar{x}_B - \bar{x}_A) = 5.68$.
Table\ \@ref(tab:SignageSummaryHT) gives the standard error for estimating this *difference* as $\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_B - \bar{x}_A) = 2.964$.
Using the summary information in Table\ \@ref(tab:SignageSummaryHT), the $t$-score (using Eq.\ \@ref(eq:tscore)) is  
\[
  t
  = \frac{(\bar{x}_B - \bar{x}_A) - (\mu_B - \mu_A)}{\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_B - \bar{x}_{A})}
  = \frac{5.68 - 0}{2.964} = 1.92.
\]
(Recall that $\mu_B - \mu_A = 0$ from the null hypothesis.)

Remembering that the alternative hypothesis is *one-tailed*, the $P$-value (using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule) is larger than $0.025$, but smaller than $0.32$... so making a clear decision is difficult without using software.
However, since the $t$-score is *just* less than 2, we suspect that the $P$-value is likely to be closer to $0.025$ than $0.32$.

From software, $P = 0.02968$ (you cannot be this precise just using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule).
Using Table\ \@ref(tab:PvaluesInterpretation), this $P$-value provides moderate evidence of a reduction in mean speeds.
We conclude:

> Moderate evidence exists in the sample ($t = 1.92$; one-tailed $P = 0.030$) that mean speeds have reduced after the addition of extra signage (Before: mean speed: $98.02$\ km.h^$-1$^; $n = 38$; standard deviation: $13.18$\ km.h^$-1$^; After:  mean speed: $92.34$\ km.h^$-1$^; $n = 41$; standard deviation: $13.13$\ km.h^$-1$^; 95% CI for the difference: $-0.24$ to $11.6$\ km.h^$-1$^).

Whether the mean speed reduction of $5.68$ has *practical importance* is a different issue.
Using the validity conditions, the CI is statistically valid.

## Example: chamomile tea {#ChamomileTea-TwoMeans-HT}

(This study was seen in Sects.\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-Paired-CI), \@ref(ChamomileTea-TwoMeans-CI) and\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-Paired-HT).)
@rafraf2015effectiveness studied patients with Type\ 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
They randomly allocated $32$ patients into a control group (who drank hot water), and $32$ to receive chamomile tea (@rafraf2015effectiveness).

The total glucose (TG) was measured for each individual, in both groups, both before the intervention and after eight weeks on the intervention.
Summary data are given in Table\ \@ref(tab:TGsummaryTable).
Evidence suggests that the chamomile tea group shows a mean reduction in TG (Sect.\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-Paired-HT)), while the hot-water group shows no evidence of a reduction.
That is, there appears to be a difference between the two groups regarding the change in TG.
However, the differences between the chamomile-tea and the hot-water groups may be due to the samples selected (i.e., sampling variation), so comparing the changes in the two groups is helpful.

The following relational RQ can be asked:

> For patients with T2DM, is the mean reduction in TG *greater* for the chamomile tea group compared to the hot water group?

Notice the RQ is one-tailed; the aim of the study is to determine if the chamomile-tea drinking group performs *better* (i.e., greater change in TG) than the control group.

This RQ is comparing two separate groups; specifically, comparing the *differences* between the two groups.
This study contains both *within*-individuals comparisons (see Sect.\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-Paired-HT)) and a *between*-individuals comparison (this section); see Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TeaSummaryAnnotated).
This is equivalent to treating the difference for both groups like two separate sets of data in the two-sample test.


```{r TeaSummaryAnnotated, fig.cap="The chamomile-tea study has two within-individuals comparisons, and a between-individuals comparison", fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("OtherImages/ChamomileTea/ChamomileSummary-BetweenWithinGroups.png")
```


The corresponding hypotheses are:  
\[
  \text{$H_0$: $\mu_T - \mu_W = 0$ \qquad and\qquad $H_1$: $\mu_T - \mu_W > 0$}
\]
where $\mu$ refers to the mean reduction in TG, $T$ refers to the tea-drinking group, and $W$ to the hot-water drinking group.

The parameter $\mu_T - \mu_W$ is estimated by the statistic $\bar{x}_T - \bar{x}_W = 45.74$\ mg.dl^$-1$^.
The standard error for the statistic was found (in Sect.\ \@ref(ChamomileTea-TwoMeans-CI)) as $\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_T - \bar{x}_W) = 8.42$.
Hence, the test statistic is:  
\[
   t 
   = \frac{(\mu_T - \mu_W) - (\bar{x}_T - \bar{x}_W)}{\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_T - \bar{x}_W)}
   = \frac{45.75 - 0}{8.42} 
   = 5.43,
\]
which is very large, so the $P$ value will be very small (using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule), and certainly smaller than $0.001$.

We write:

> There is very strong evidence ($t = 5.43$; one-tailed $P < 0.001$) that the mean reduction in TG for the chamomile-tea drinking group (mean reduction: $36.62$\ mg.dl^$-1$^) is greater than the mean reduction in TG for the hot-water drinking group (mean reduction: $-7.12$\ mg.dl^$-1$^; difference between means: $45.74$\ mg.dl^$-1$^; approx. $95$% CI: $28.64$ to $62.84$\ mg.dl^$-1$^).

Again, the sample sizes are larger than $25$, so the results are statistically valid.


## Chapter summary {#Chap30-Summary}

To test a hypothesis about a difference between two population means $\mu_A - \mu_B$:

* Write the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$).
* Initially *assume* the value of $(\mu_A - \mu_B)$ in the null hypothesis to be true.
* Then, describe the *sampling distribution*, which describes what to *expect*  from the difference between the sample means based on this assumption: under certain statistical validity conditions, the difference between the sample means vary with:
   *  an approximate normal distribution,
   *  with sampling mean whose value is the value of $(\mu_A - \mu_B)$ (from $H_0$), and
   *  having a standard deviation of $\displaystyle \text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B)$.
* Compute the value of the *test statistic*:  
\[
   t = \frac{ (\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) - (\mu_A - \mu_B)}{\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B)},
\]
where $\mu_A - \mu_B$ is the hypothesised difference given in the null hypothesis.
* The $t$-value is like a $z$-score, and so an approximate *$P$-value* can be estimated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, or found using software.

At one site studied (Ningxuan Freeway), speeds were recorded at various points on the freeway exit for vehicles *before* the extra signage was added, and then for different vehicles *after* the extra signage was added.

From this data, the *deceleration* of each vehicle was determined 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:SignageSummaryData))'
} else {
   '(Exercise\\ \\@ref(exr:CompareQuantDeceleration))'
}`
as the vehicle left the $120$\ km.h^$-1$^ speed zone and approached the $80$\ km.h^$-1$^ speed zone. 
Use the data, and the summary in Table\ \@ref(tab:SignageSummaryDecHT), to test the RQ:

> At this freeway exit, is the mean vehicle deceleration the same before extra signage is added and after extra signage is added?

::: {.exercise #FacePlantHT}
[*Dataset*: `ForwardFall`]
(This study was seen in Exercise\ \@ref(exr:FacePlantCI).)
A study [@data:Wojcik:ForwardFall] compared the lean-forward angle in younger and older women (Table\ \@ref(tab:FacePlant)).
An elaborate set-up was constructed to measure this lean-forward angle, using harnesses.
Consider this RQ:

> Among healthy women, is the mean lean-forward angle *greater* for younger women compared to older women?

Use the software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:FallFowardTTestTestjamovi)) to answer these questions:

1. What is the parameter?
   Carefully describe what it means.
1. Is the test one- or two-tailed?
1. Write the statistical hypothesis.
1. Use the jamovi output to conduct the hypothesis test.
1. Write a conclusion.
1. Is the test statistically valid?

::: {.exercise #BHADPHT}
(This study was seen in Exercise\ \@ref(exr:BHADPCI).)
@data:Becker1991:BHADP compared the access to health promotion (HP) services for people with and without a disability in southwestern of the USA.
'Access' was measured using the quantitative
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '*Barriers to Health Promoting Activities for Disabled Persons*  (BHADP) scale.'
} else {
   '*Barriers to Health Promoting Activities for Disabled Persons*  [(BHADP) scale](http://www.utexas.edu/nursing/chpr/resources/bhadp.html).'
}`
*Higher* scores mean *greater* barriers to health promotion services.
The RQ is:

> What is the difference between the mean BHADP scores, for people with and without a disability, in southwestern USA?

1. What is the parameter?
   Carefully describe what it means.
1. Write down the hypotheses.
1. Compute the $t$-score.
1. Determine the $P$-value.
1. Write a conclusion.
1. Is the test statistically valid?
