# Summarising connections between two quantitative variables

## Graphs

Scatterplots display the relationship between *two quantitative variables*.
Conventionally, when appropriate, the response variable is on the vertical axis, and the explanatory variable is on the horizontal axis.
As with any graph, describing the message in the graph is important, because the purpose of a graph is to display the information in the clearest, simplest possible way.
*Scatterplots* can be described by briefly explaining how the variables are related to each other.
Scatterplots are studied further in Sect.\ \@ref(Scatterplots).

::: {.example #WaterAccessScatter name="Scatterplots"}
A study of three rural communities in Cameroon [@lopez2022farmers] recorded data about access to water (Sect.\ \@ref(WaterAccessQuant)).

The graphs (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:WaterAccessScatter)) and summary (Table\ \@ref(tab:WaterAccessCompareQuantTabs)) show that

data(WaterAccess)

plot( HouseholdPeople ~ Age,
      data = WaterAccess)
      las = 1,
      xlim = c(15, 65),
      ylim = c(0, 350),
      main = "Numer of people per household\nagainst age of female household coordinator",
      xlab = "Age of coordinator (in years)",
      ylab = "Number in household",
      pch = 19)
```




## Summary tables {#ConnectionSummaryTables}

The numerical summary information the relationship between *two quantitative variables* can be collated in a table.
The data should be summarised each variable.


```{r AISTable}
WATable <- array( dim = c(2, 3))

rownames(WATable) <- c("Number in houshold",
                        "Age") 
colnames(WATable) <- c("Mean",
                        "Std. dev.",
                        "Sample size") 


WATable[, 1] <- round(colMeans(WaterAccess[, c(2, 8) ]), 1)
WATable[, 2] <- round(apply(WaterAccess[, c(2, 8)], 2, "sd"), 2)
WATable[, 3] <- round(apply(WaterAccess[, c(2, 8)], 2, "realLength"), 0)

knitr::kable( pad(WATable,
                  surroundMaths = TRUE,
                  targetLength = c(4, 5, 3),
                  digits = c(1, 2, 0)),
              format = "latex",
              longtable = FALSE,
              booktabs = TRUE,
              escape = FALSE,
              digits = 1,
              align = "c",
              caption = "A numerical summary of the water-access data") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(row = 0, 
           bold = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(row = 3,
           italic = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10)
```
