Since two groups are being compared, subscripts are used to distinguish between the statistics for the two groups; say, Groups\ $A$ and\ $B$ in general (Table\ \@ref(tab:ORHT)).
For this example, we use\ $N$ to refer to students *not* living with their parents, and\ $L$ for students living with their parents.

The parameter can be either a difference between two population proportions, or a population odds ratio.
For example, the parameter could be difference between population proportion of students eating most meals *off*-campus, comparing students living with their parents, to students *not* living with their parents; that is, $p_L - p_N$.
(Of course, the parameter could be defined as $p_N - p_L$ also.)
Alternatively (and equivalently), the parameter could be the population\ OR of eating most meals *off*-campus, comparing students living with their parents, to students *not* living with their parents.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The table can be constructed with either variable as the rows or the columns.
However, software commonly compares *rows* (for example, see the text under the bottom table in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi)), so it makes sense to place the groups to be compared (i.e., the explanatory variable) in the rows of the table.

Then, the difference between the two proportions are usually calculated as the Row\ 1 proportion minus the Row\ 2 proportion.
Similarly, the odds then can be interpreted as\index{Odds ratio!interpreting}\index{Software output!odds ratios} comparing Column\ 1 counts to Column\ 2 counts, and the *odds ratio* as comparing the Row\ 1 odds to the Row\ 2 odds.
:::


The RQ and the hypotheses can be written as comparing *proportions* (Sect.\ \@ref(CompareTwoProportions)), comparing *odds* (Sect.\ \@ref(CompareTwoOdds)), or about *odds ratios*.
Means are *not* appropriate (the data contain two *qualitative* variables).

## Comparing two proportions: $z$-test {#CompareTwoProportions}

To compare the two proportions, the two-tailed RQ is:

> Is the *population* proportion of students eating most meals off-campus the same for students *living with* their parents and for students *not living with* their parents?

As usual, the population values are unknown, so this is estimated using the statistic $\hat{p}_L - \hat{p}_N$.

Hypothesis testing always begins by assuming that the null hypothesis is true (Sect.\ \@ref(HypothesisNull)).
In this context, that means assuming that the population proportion of eating most meals off-campus is the same in both groups:

* $H_0$: $p_L - p_N = 0$ (equivalent to $p_L = p_N$).

From the RQ, the alternative hypothesis is *two*-tailed:

* $H_1$: $p_L - p_N \ne 0$ (equivalent to $p_L \ne p_N$).

Because we assume the null hypothesis to be true, we assume the proportions are the same for both groups.
Hence, the data from the two groups can be combined to determine an overall (or common) proportion of students eating most meals off-campus:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{p} = \frac{52 + 105}{52 + 105 + 2 + 24} = \frac{157}{183} = 0.85792.
   (\#eq:OverallP)
\end{equation}
This is the overall proportion of students eating most meals off-campus, assuming no difference between students living with and not with their parents.

The *sample* proportions for the two groups ($L$ and\ $N$) will vary from sample to sample and so have a sampling distribution (as in Sect.\ \@ref(OnePropTestSamplingDist)).
The standard error of the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ for each sample is computed using this common proportion, using the same idea as in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:StdErrorPknown):
\begin{align*}
  \text{s.e.}(p_L) &= \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\times(1 - \hat{p})}{n_L}} = \sqrt{ \frac{0.85792\times(1 - 0.85792)}{54}} = 0.047511; \text{and}\\
  \text{s.e.}(p_N) &= \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}\times(1 - \hat{p})}{n_N}} = \sqrt{ \frac{0.85792\times(1 - 0.85792)}{129}} = 0.030739.
\end{align*}


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
When computing the standard errors as part of a *hypothesis test*, the common or overall proportion is used to compute the standard errors.
:::


The difference between the two proportions will vary from sample to sample too, and hence have a sampling distribution; under certain conditions (Sect.\ \@ref(Validity-Test-ChiSq)), this sampling distribution will have a normal distribution.
The standard error of this sampling distribution for the *difference* between the proportions is
$$
  \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B) = \sqrt{ \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_L)^2 +  \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_N)^2 }
  =
  \sqrt{ 0.047511^2 + 0.030739^2} = 0.056588,
$$
similar to Eq.\ \@ref(eq:SEtwoproportionsCI).


::: {.definition #DEFSamplingDistributionDiffProportionsHT name="Sampling distribution for the difference between two sample proportions"}
The *sampling distribution of the difference between two sample proportions*\ $\hat{p}_A$ and\ $\hat{p}_B$ is (when the appropriate conditions are met; Sect.\ \@ref(Validity-Test-ChiSq)) described by:

* an approximate normal distribution,
* centred around a sampling mean whose value is ${p_{A}} - {p_{B}}$, the difference between the *population* proportions (from $H_0$),
* with a standard deviation, called the standard error of the difference between the proportions, of $\displaystyle\text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B)$.

The standard error for the difference between the proportions is
$$
  \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B) = \sqrt{ \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A)^2 +  \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_B)^2 },
$$
where
$$
  \text{s.e.}(p_A) = \sqrt{ \frac{p\times(1 - p)}{n_A}}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \text{s.e.}(p_B) = \sqrt{ \frac{p\times(1 - p)}{n_B}},
$$
where\ $p$ is the common (overall) proportion.
:::


Since the sampling distribution has an approximate normal distribution, the test statistic is\index{Test statistic!z@$z$-score}
$$
  z = \frac{ (\hat{p}_L - \hat{p}_N) - (p_L - p_N) }{\text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B)} \
    = \frac{ 0.14901 - 0}{0.056588} 
    = 2.633.
$$
Since the sampling distribution has an approximate normal distribution, the approximate $P$-value can be computed from normal distributions (Sect.\ \@ref(ExactAreasUsingTables)), approximated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule,\index{68@$68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule} or from software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi)).
The two-tailed $P$-value reported by software (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi), under the column\ `p`) is indeed small: $0.008$ to three decimal places.

A very small $P$-value means strong evidence exists to supporting\ $H_1$: the evidence suggests a difference between the *population* proportions.
We write:

> The *sample* provides strong evidence ($z = 2.63$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$) that the proportion of students in the *population* of having most meals off-campus is different for students living with their parents (proportion: $0.963$, $n = 54$) and students *not* living with their parents (proportion: $0.814$, $n = 129$; difference: $0.149$; $95$%\ CI from\ $0.0633$ to\ $0.235$, higher for students living with their parents).

The conclusion includes three components (Sect.\ \@ref(WordingConclusion)): the *answer to the RQ*; the *evidence* used to reach that conclusion ('$z = 2.63$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$'); and some *sample summary statistics* (including the $95$%\ CI for the difference between proportions; Sect.\ \@ref(CIDiffBetweenProportions)).
The conclusion also makes clear which proportion is higher.


## Comparing two odds: $\chi^2$-test {#CompareTwoOdds}

For the $2\times 2$ table of counts in Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT), odds can be compared rather than proportions:

> Are the *population odds* of students eating most meals off-campus the same for students *living with* their parents and for students *not living with* their parents?

If the odds are the same in the two groups, this is equivalent to an odds ratio of one.
Hence, the RQ could also be written as

> Is the *population odds ratio* of eating most meals off-campus, comparing students who live *with their* parents to students *not living with* their parents, equal to one?

Either way, the *parameter* is the population odds ratio, and the null hypothesis is the 'no difference, no change, no relationship' position:

* $H_0$: The *population*\ OR is one; or (equivalently):  
  \phantom{$H_0$:{}} The *population* odds are the same in each group.

This hypothesis proposes that the *sample* odds are not the same in the two groups only due to sampling variation.
This is the initial *assumption*.
The alternative hypothesis is

* $H_1$: The *population*\ OR is not one; or (equivalently):  
  \phantom{$H_0$:{}} The *population* odds are *not* the same in each group.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
For comparing odds, the alternative hypotheses *is always two-tailed*.
:::


In our example then:

* $H_0$: The *population* odds of eating most meals off-campus are the *same* for students living with their parents and for students not living with their parents.
* $H_1$: The *population* odds of eating most meals off-campus are *different* for students living with their parents and for students not living with their parents.

As usual, the decision-making process starts by *assuming* the null hypothesis is true: that the *population* odds ratio is one (i.e., the population odds in each group are equal).



### Finding expected counts {#ExpectedValues}

Assuming that the odds of having most meals off-campus is the same for both groups (that is, the population\ OR is one), how would the sample\ OR be *expected* to vary from sample to sample just because of *sampling variation*?
If the null hypothesis is true, the odds are the same in both groups (and the proportions are the same in both groups).
That is, the proportions of students eating most meals off-campus is the same for students *living with* and *not living with* their parents.

Let's consider the implication.
From Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT), $157$\ students out of $183$ ate most meals off-campus, so that $157\div 183 = 0.8579$ of students in the entire sample ate most of their meals off-campus (the same value found in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:OverallP).)

If the proportions of students who eat most of their meals off-campus is the *same* for those who live with their parents and those who don't, then we'd *expect* $0.8579$\ of students in *both* groups to be eating most meals off-campus.
(These values were also found in Sect.\ \@ref(ValidityConditionsORCI).)
In other words, the two *conditional* probabilities\index{Probability!conditional} would be the same.
In that case, we would *expect*:

* A proportion of\ $0.8579$ of the $54$\ students who *live with their parents* (i.e., $0.8579\times 54 = 46.33$ students) to eat most meals off-campus; and
* A proportion of\ $0.8579$ of the $129$\ students who *don't live with their parents* (i.e., $0.8579\times 129 = 110.67$ students) to eat most meals off-campus.

In other words, the proportions (and hence the odds) of eating most meals off-campus is the same in each group.
Those are the *expected* counts if the proportions (or odds) was exactly the same in each group (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected)), as stated by\ $H_0$.

How close are the *observed* counts (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT)) to the *expected counts* (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected))?

* $46.33$ of the $54$\ students who *live with their parents* are *expected* to eat most meals off-campus; yet we observed\ $52$.
* $110.67$ of the $129$\ students who *don't live with their parents* are *expected* to eat most meals off-campus; yet we observed\ $105$.

The observed and expected counts are similar, but not the exactly same.
The difference between the observed and expected counts *may* be explained by sampling variation (that is, the null hypothesis explanation).

The hypothesis test effectively compares the observed counts to the expected counts (assuming no relationship between the variables) over the whole $2\times 2$ table.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
You *do not* have to compute the expected values when you answer one of these types of RQs (software does it in the background).
However, seeing how the decision-making process works in this context is helpful.
:::


In previous hypothesis tests, the *sampling distribution* had an approximate normal distribution.
However, the sampling distribution of the odds ratio is more complicated^[For those interested: the *logarithm* of the sample ORs have an approximate normal distribution, and hence a *standard error*.] so will not be presented.
We will use software output only to conduct the test.

### Computing the value of the test statistic {#TestStatObs}
\index{Hypothesis testing!odds ratio}

The decision-making process compares what is *expected* if the null hypothesis about the parameter is true (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected)) to what is *observed* in the sample (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT)).
Previously, when the summary statistics were means and the sampling distribution was a normal distribution, the test statistic was a $t$-score.
However, the data here are not summarised by means, the sampling distribution is *not* a normal distribution, and so a different test statistic is needed.

Here, the test-statistic is a 'chi-squared' statistic, written $\chi^2$.\index{Test statistic!$\chi^2$-score}\index{chi@$\chi^2$-score}
The $\chi^2$-score measures the overall size of the differences between the expected counts and observed counts, over the entire $2\times 2$ table.


:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}

::: {style="display: flex;"}
The Greek letter $\chi$ is pronounced 'ki', as in **ki**te (*not* 'chi' as in **Chi**na).
The test statistic $\chi^2$ is pronounced as 'chi-squared'.

```
:::

::::



From the software (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi)), $\chi^2 = 6.934$.
But what does this value *mean*?
Is it 'large' or 'small'?

The $\chi^2$-value can be understood by finding the equivalent $z$-score, which means a $P$-value can be estimated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule.
The $\chi^2$-value is equivalent to
$$
  z = \sqrt{\chi^2}\qquad\text{for a $2\times 2$ table of counts only}.
$$
Here then, the $\chi^2$-value is equivalent to a $z$-score of $\sqrt{6.934} = 2.633$.
This is the *same* $z$-score produced when comparing two proportions (Sec.\ \@ref(CompareTwoProportions); Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi)), and hence the $P$-value will be the same also.
Using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, a small $P$-value is expected.
The two-tailed $P$-value reported by software (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi), under the column\ `p`) is indeed small: $0.008$ to three decimals.

   
::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Recall that $\chi^2$-tests always have *two-tailed* alternative hypotheses, so two-tailed $P$-values are always reported.

### Writing conclusions {#WritingConclusionChi2}

A very small $P$-value ($0.008$ to three decimals) means strong evidence exists to supporting\ $H_1$: the evidence suggests a difference in the *population* odds in the two groups.
We write:

> The *sample* provides strong evidence ($\chi^2 = 6.934$, $n = 54$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$) that the odds in the *population* of having most meals off-campus is different for students living with their parents (odds:\ $26$) and students *not* living with their parents (odds:\ $4.375$, $n = 129$; OR: $5.94$; $95$%\ CI from\ $1.35$ to\ $26.1$).

The conclusion includes three components (Sect.\ \@ref(WordingConclusion)): the *answer to the RQ*; the *evidence* used to reach that conclusion ('$\chi^2 = 6.934$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$'); and some *sample summary statistics* (including the $95$%\ CI for the odds ratio).

The conclusion also makes clear what the odds and the odds ratio *mean*.
The odds are describing as the 'odds of having most meals off-campus', and the OR as then comparing these odds between 'students living with their parents and students *not* living with their parents'.


## Statistical validity conditions {#Validity-Test-ChiSq}
\index{Statistical validity!odds ratio}

As usual, these results hold under certain conditions.
The tests above are statistically valid if: 

* All *expected* counts are at least five.

Some books may give other (but similar) conditions.

The statistical validity condition refers to the *expected* (not the *observed*) counts.
In some software, the *expected* counts must be explicitly requested to see if this condition is satisfied (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestExpectedjamovi)).

The units of analysis are also assumed to be *independent* (e.g., from a simple random sample).

If the statistical validity conditions are not met, other similar options include using a Fisher's exact test\index{Fisher's exact test} [@conover2003practical] or using resampling methods [@efron2021computer].


```{r UniMealsTestExpectedjamovi, fig.cap="The expected values, as computed by software.", fig.align="center", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("jamovi/UniStudents/UniStudents-Expected.png")
```


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityEatingHT name="Statistical validity"}
For the student-eating data, the smallest *observed* count is\ $2$ (living with parents; most meals off-campus), but the smallest *expected* count (see Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected) or Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestExpectedjamovi)) is\ $7.67$, which is greater than five.
This means the two tests (comparing proportions; comparing odds) are both statistically valid.
The size of the *expected* counts is important for the statistical validity condition.
:::


As noted in Sect.\ \@ref(ValidityConditionsORCI), *usually, you do not have to compute these expected values*, as software can produce the *expected* counts (e.g.,  Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestExpectedjamovi)).
However, a quick check for the statistical validity is to compute the value of the *smallest* expected value, using
$$
  \frac{(\text{Smallest row total})\times(\text{Smallest column total})}{\text{Overall total}}.
$$
If this value is greater than five, the tests are statistically valid.


## Tests of independence more generally: $\chi^2$-tests {#CompareManyProportions}

Often a table of counts is larger than $2\times 2$.
In these situations, the RQ is worded in terms of *independence*, *relationships* or *associations* (but *not* correlations) between the variables:

> Is there a relationship (or association) between one qualitative variable and another qualitative variable?

The RQ is answered using a $\chi^2$-test, by extending the ideas in Sect.\ \@ref(CompareTwoOdds), as demonstrated in the following example.
If one of the qualitative variable has two levels,\index{Levels} the RQ may be worded in terms of odds or proportions.

:::{.example #ChiSqLarger name="Two-way tables larger than $2\times 2$"}
[*Dataset*: `RipsID`]
@diez2023rip studied Spanish people's knowledge of ocean rips
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:RipTableSummary), left table).'
} else {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:RipTableDataHTML).'
}`
The table is a $4\times 2$ two-way table.
The rows are the age groups, as the age groups are being compared.
The RQ is

> Is there a relationship (or association) between age group and people's ability to correctly identify a rip?

Since one variable (whether the person can identify a rip) has two levels, the RQ may be worded as:

> Are the odds of Spaniards correctly identifying a rip the same for each age group?

or 

> Is the proportion of Spaniards correctly identifying a rip the same for each age group?

The odds and percentage of people in each age group that can correctly identify rips can be computed
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:RipTableSummary), right table),'
} else {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:RipTableSummaryHTML),'
}`
but this is not always possible (e.g., for a $3\times 4$ table).
Odds ratios compare *pairs* of odds, and the odds ratios in 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Table\\ \\@ref(tab:RipTableSummary) (right table)'
} else {
   'Table\\ \\@ref(tab:RipTableSummaryHTML)'
}`
are all relative to those\ $51$ to\ $65$ (hence, no odds ratio is given for the $51$ to\ $65$ age group, which is the *reference level*).\index{Reference level}
For example, the odds of someone aged\ $18$ to\ $24$ correctly identifying a rip is\ $1.104$ times the odds of someone aged\ $51$ to\ $65$ correctly identifying a rip.

Because one of the variables has two levels, the hypotheses can be worded in terms of comparing odds or comparing proportions; for example:

* $H_0$: The *population* odds of correctly identifying a rip is the same for all age groups.
* $H_1$: The *population* odds of correctly identifying a rip is *not* the same for all age groups.

The alternative hypothesis encompasses many possibilities: for example, that the three odds are *all* different from each other, or that the odds for the first age group is different than the other two (which are the same).

For tables larger than $2\times 2$ more generally, the hypothesis are usually worded in terms of associations or relationships between the variables (but *not* correlations):

* $H_0$: In the *population*, there *is no association* between correctly identifying a rip and age group;
* $H_1$: In the *population*, there *is an association* between correctly identifying a rip and age group.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
For two-way tables, RQs can be framed in terms of ORs, comparing odds, comparing proportions, or using associations (or relationships).

For consistency: if the RQ is about the odds ratio, the hypotheses and conclusion should be about the odds ratio; if the RQ is about odds, the hypotheses and conclusion should be about the odds; and so on.
:::


The test statistic is again a $\chi^2$-value, which compares the observed and expected counts; the expected counts are found in the same way as in Sect.\ \@ref(ExpectedValues).
For two-way tables larger than $2\times 2$ (see Sect.\ \@ref(HTCompareOddsBurros)), the parameter describing the association between the variables is the $\chi^2$-value itself.
When no relationship exists in the sample, the observed and expected values are the same, and $\chi^2 = 0$.
The larger the difference between the observed and expected values, the larger the value of\ $\chi^2$.
Sampling variation means that the observed values will vary from sample to sample, so that\ $\chi^2$ may not be exactly zero, even if there is no association between the variables.

Software computes $\chi^2 = 2.406$ (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:Ripsjamovi)).
The two-tailed $P$-value is (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:Ripsjamovi), left panel) $P = 0.492$.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
For comparing more than two odds or proportions, the alternative hypothesis *is always two-tailed*.

<!-- * $-2.0$: Students *living with their parents* are *less likely* (because the residual is *negative*) to eat most meals on-campus -->

<!-- * $1.3$: Students *not living with their parents*  are *more likely* (because the residual is *positive*) to eat mostmeals on-campus -->

The corresponding hypotheses can be written using proportion, after defining\ $p$ as the proportion of nests that are *infected*:

* $H_0$: $p_N - p_R =   0$ (equivalent to $p_N =   p_R$); and
* $H_1$: $p_N - p_R \ne 0$ (equivalent to $p_N \ne p_R$),

where\ $N$ refers to **N**atural nests, and\ $R$ to **R**elocated nests.
The parameter is the odds difference between the population proportion.

The hypotheses can also be written using odds:

* $H_0$: The odds of a nest being infected is     *the same* for natural and relocated nests; and
* $H_1$: The odds of a nest being infected is *not the same* for natural and relocated nests.

The parameter is the odds ratio of infection, comparing natural to relocated nests.

A graphical summary is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TurtleNestsGraphs).
A numerical summary table (Table\ \@ref(tab:TurtleNestDataTable), right table) shows that the odds of natural nest being infected is $1.657$\ times the odds of a relocated nest being infected.
From the software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TurtleNestsOutputjamoviHT)), the $\chi^2$-value is\ $0.777$.
This is like a $z$-score of $z = \sqrt{0.777/1} = 0.88$, which is very small, so expect a large $P$-value.
(Notice that this is the value of the $z$-score shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TurtleNestsOutputjamoviHT) for comparing two proportions.)
The $P$-value is\ $0.378$ on the output (for both tests).

The smallest *expected* count is $22\times 18 / 61 = 6.49$, which exceeds five, so these tests are statistically valid.
We write:

> There is no evidence of a difference in the odds of infection ($\chi^2$: $0.777$; $P$-value: $0.378$; odds ratio: $1.657$ ($95$%\ CI: $0.537$ to\ $5.12$)) between natural nests (odds: $2.90$; $n = 39$) and relocated nests (odds: $1.75$; $n = 22$).

The conclusion could also be written in terms of proportions:

> There is no evidence of a difference in the proportion of infection (difference between proportions: $0.108$ ($95$%\ CI from\ $-0.136$ to\ $0.527$); $z = 0.882$; $P$-value: $0.378$) between natural nests ($p = 0.744$; $n = 39$) and relocated nests ($p = 0.636$; $n = 22$).

Either way, there no evidence that relocating the nest (to protect them from tidal inundation) changes the risk of infection.


:::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
We *do not* say whether the evidence supports the null hypothesis.
We assume the null hypothesis is true, so we state how strong the evidence is to change our mind (and hence support the alternative hypothesis).
The current sample presents no evidence to contradict the assumption, but future evidence may emerge.

## Example: health of female burros {#HTCompareOddsBurros}

@johnson1987demography studied $315$\ introduced female burros (donkeys) in the Mojave Desert (California) to understand management processes. 
One RQ was:

> For these female burros, is the reproductive status of the burros related to their health?

The data
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:BurrosData), left table)'
} else {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:BurrosDataHTML))'
}`
are given in a $3\times 3$ table of counts.
The data are summarised using row proportions in
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Table\\ \\@ref(tab:BurrosData) (right table),'
} else {
   'Table\\ \\@ref(tab:BurrosSummaryHTML)),'
}`
and in a graph in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BurrosChisqjamoviPlot) (left panel).
Software output is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BurrosChisqjamoviPlot) (right panel).
(Odds could be produced in the numerical summary also, but odds ratios are trickier since they require comparing pairs of odds.)

The hypothesis are usually worded in terms of associations (or *relationships*):

* $H_0$: *No association* exists between reproductive status and overall health.
* $H_1$: *An association* exists between reproductive status and overall health.

From the software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BurrosChisqjamoviPlot), right panel), $\chi^2 = 23.585$.
Notice that a comparison of proportions is not possible for tables larger than $2\times 2$.
Software reports $P < 0.001$, which suggests very strong evidence in the sample that an association exists between reproductive status and overall health.

The conclusion could be written as

> The sample provides very strong evidence ($\chi^2 = 23.585$) of an association between reproductive status and overall health of female burros ($n = 315$).

Adding sample summary information to this conclusion is cumbersome.
Instead, readers can be pointed to the numerical summary
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:BurrosData), right table).'
} else {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:BurrosSummaryHTML)).'
}`
Furthermore, CIs are not reported since software does not always produce CIs for tables larger than $2\times 2$.

While we know there is an association between the variables, we can only speculate on the nature of the association (i.e., for which group(s) the *population* proportions are different).
Doing so requires methods beyond this book.

The smallest *expected* value is $75\times 34/315 = 8.1$, which exceeds\ $5$, so the results are statistically valid.



## Chapter summary {#TestsOddsRatio-Summary}

To test a hypothesis about a difference between two population proportions $p_A - p_B$:

* Write the null hypothesis\ ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis\ ($H_1$).
* Initially *assume* the value of $(p_A - p_B)$ in the null hypothesis to be true.
* Then, describe the *sampling distribution*, which describes what to *expect*  from the difference between the sample proportions based on this assumption: under certain statistical validity conditions, the difference between the sample proportions vary with:
   *  an approximate normal distribution,
   *  with sampling mean whose value is the value of $(p_A - p_B)$ (from $H_0$), and
   *  having a standard deviation of $\displaystyle \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B)$.
* Compute the value of the *test statistic*:
$$
   z = \frac{ (\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B) - (p_A - p_B)}{\text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B)},
$$
where $p_A - p_B$ is the hypothesised difference given in the null hypothesis.
* The $t$-value is like a $z$-score, and so an approximate *$P$-value* can be estimated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, or found using software.
* Make a decision, and write a conclusion.

To test a hypothesis for comparing two odds, or to test for a relationship between two qualitative variables more generally:

* Write the null hypothesis\ ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis\ ($H_1$).
* Initially *assume* no relationship between the two variables.
* Find the value of the *test statistic* (a $\chi^2$-score) on the software output.
  (For $2\times 2$ tables only, the equivalent $z$-score is\ $\sqrt{\chi^2}$.
* A *$P$-value* is found using software.
* Make a decision, and write a conclusion.
* Check the statistical validity conditions.
