So far,
you have learnt to
ask a RQ, 
identify different ways of obtaining data,
design the study,
collect the data
describe the data,
summarise data graphically and numerically,
understand the tools of inference,
to form *confidence intervals*,
and
to perform *hypothesis tests*.

**In this chapter**,
you will learn about *correlation*.
You will learn to:

* produce correlation coefficients for exploring the relationship between two quantitative variables.
* produce and interpret $R^2$.
* conduct hypothesis tests for correlation coefficients.

## Correlation coefficients {#CorrCoefficients}

Describing the *linear* relationship between two *quantitative* variables,
requires a description of the form, direction and variation.
A *correlation coefficient* is a single number encapsulating all this information.

In the *population*,
the unknown value of the correlation coefficient is denoted $\rho$ ('rho');
in the *sample* the value of the correlation coefficient is denoted $r$.
As usual,
$r$ (the *statistic*) is an estimate of $\rho$ (the *parameter*),
and the value of $r$ is likely to be different in every sample
(that is, *sampling variation* exists).




:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{pronounce}"}

::: {style="display: flex;"}
The symbol $\rho$ is the Greek letter 'rho', pronounced 'row', as in ['row your boat'](https://youtu.be/7otAJa3jui8).

Correlation coefficients only apply if the form is approximately *linear*,
so checking if the relationship is linear first (using a scatterplot) is important.
Here,
the *Pearson* correlation coefficient is discussed,
which is suitable for describing linear relationships between quantitative 
data^[Other types of correlation coefficients also exist, such as the *Spearman* correlation, which may be used for monotonic, non-linear relationships.].


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{important}"}
The Pearson correlation coefficient only make sense if the relationship is approximately linear.
:::


The values of $\rho$ and $r$ are *always* between $-1$ and $+1$.
The *sign* indicates whether the relationship has a positive or negative linear association, 
and the *value* of the correlation coefficient tells us the strength of the relationship:

* $r = 0$ means *no linear relationship* between the two variables:
  Knowing how the value of $x$ changes tells us nothing about how the value of $y$ changes.
* $r= +1$ means a *perfect, positive* relationship:
  knowing the value of $x$ means we can perfectly predict the value of $y$ 
  (and *larger* values of $y$ are associated with *larger* values of $x$, in general).
* $r = -1$ means a *perfect, negative* relationship:
  knowing the value of $x$ means we can perfectly predict the value of $y$
  (and *larger* values of $y$ are associated with *smaller* values of $x$, in general).

Earlier, we looked at the NHANES data to explore
the relationship between direct HDL cholesterol and current smoking status.

The NHANES project is an observational study,
so confounding is a potential issue.
For this reason,
relationships between the 
response and extraneous variables, and between explanatory and extraneous variables,
should be examined.

For example,
the relationship between
Age (an extraneous variables) and direct HDL cholesterol (the response variable) is shown

Software is used to compute the value of $r$.
For the red deer data
(Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)),
the relationship is approximately linear,
and the
jamovi output
(Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerCorrelationjamovi))
and
SPSS output
(Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerCorrelationSPSS))
show that $r = -0.584$:

* Direction: The *sign* of $r$ indicates the direction.
  Here we see a *negative* relationship:
  Higher ages are associated with lighter molars (in general),
  which makes sense.
* Variation:
  The *value* of $r$ indicates the strength of the relationship.
  Here,
  perhaps we could describe the variation as moderate.

## R-squared ($R^2$) {#R2}

While using $r$ tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship,
knowing exactly what the value *means* is tricky.
Interpretation is easier using $R^2$, or 'R-squared':
the square of the value of $r$.

   'The animation below shows some values of $R^2$.'

The value of $R^2$ is never negative.
However, you need to be careful when using your calculator!
  
With most calculators,
entering `-0.5^2` will return `-0.25`.
This is correct, because the calculator interprets your input as meaning
`-(0.25^2)`.

You need to enter 
`(-0.5)^2`.
This will give you the expected answer of `0.25`.

## Hypothesis testing {#CorrelationTesting}

### Introduction {#CorTesting-Intro}



<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/diana-parkhouse-Qf4eZXC3t2Y-unsplash.jpg" width="200px">
</div>


For the red deer data (Sect. \@ref(RedDeerData); Sect. \@ref(CorrCoefficients)),
the population correlation coefficient 
between the weight of molars $y$ and age of the deer $x$
is unknown and denoted by $\rho$.

The sample correlation coefficient is
$r = `r round(cor(RD$Age, RD$Weight), 3)`$,
but the value of $r$ varies from sample to sample
(there is *sampling variation*).\index{sampling variation!correlation coefficient}

The size of the sampling variation is measured with a *standard error*.
However,
there is a complication for correlation coefficients^[For those who want to know: 
the value of $r$ only varies between $-1$ and $1$, so the sampling distribution is not a normal distribution.

Instead, a transformation of the correlation coefficient has an approximate normal distribution and *standard error*.
Software automatically does this transforming.];
so we will not produce CIs for the correlation coefficient.




### Hypothesis testing details

As usual, 
questions can be asked about the relationship between the variables,
as measured by the unknown *population* correlation coefficient:

> Is the *population* correlation coefficient zero, or not?

In the context of the red deer data:

> In male red deer, 
> is there a correlation between age and the weight of molars?

The RQ is about the population parameter $\rho$.
Clearly,
the *sample* correlation coefficient $r$ is not zero,
and the RQ is asking
whether this could be attributed to sampling variation.
The null hypotheses is:

* $H_0$: $\rho = 0$ 

The parameter is $\rho$,
the population correlation between the age and molar weight in the red deer.

This is the usual 'no relationship' position,
which proposes that the population correlation coefficient is zero.
The alternative hypothesis is:

* $H_1$:  $\rho \ne 0$

This is a *two-tailed* test here, based on the RQ.

The approach is to **assume** that $\rho=0$ (from $H_0$),
then describe what values of $r$ could be **expected**, under that assumption,
just through sampling variation.
Then the **observed** value of $r$ is compared to the
expected values to determine if the valuew of $r$ supports or contradicts the assumption.

Software is used to test the hypotheses; 
the output in
Figs. \@ref(fig:RedDeerCorrelationjamovi) (jamovi) 
and \@ref(fig:RedDeerCorrelationSPSS) (SPSS) 
contains the relevant $P$-value 
(twice in the SPSS output!).

The two-tailed $P$-value for the test 
(labelled `Sig.` by SPSS) is less than 0.001
(`0.000` in SPSS).
That is,
the $P$-value is zero *to three decimal places*,
so there is *very strong evidence* to support $H_1$
(that the correlation in the population is not zero).

We write:

> The sample presents very strong evidence 
> (two-tailed $P < 0.001$)
> of a correlation between molar weight and the age of the male red deer
> ($r = -0.584$; $n = 78$)
> in the population.

Notice the three features of writing conclusions again:
An *answer to the RQ*;
evidence to support the conclusion ('two-tailed $P < 0.001$'; no test statistic is given);
and some *sample summary information* ('$r = -0.584$; $n = 78$').


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{tip}"}
The evidence suggests that the correlation is not zero (in the population).
However,
a *non-zero* correlation
doesn't necessarily mean a *strong* correlation.

The correlation may be weak in the population (as estimated by the value of $r$), 
but there is evidence that it is not zero in the *population*.
:::


This may be a useful analogy:
If a rain forecast says 'there is a very high chance of rain tomorrow',
it doesn't mean there will be a *lot* of rain, 
just a high chance of *some* rain.

### Statistical validity conditions {#ValidityCorrelation}

As usual, 
these results hold under 
[certain conditions to be met](#exm:StatisticalValidityAnalogy).
The conditions for which the test is statistically valid are:

1. The relationship is approximately linear.
1. The variation in the response variable is approximately constant 
   for all values of the explanatory variable.
1. The sample size is at least 25.

The sample size of 25 is a rough figure here, 
and some books give other values.

In addition to the statistical validity condition,
the test will be 
[**externally valid**](#def:ExternalValidity) 
if the
the sample is a [simple random sample](#SRS) from the population.
The test will also be 
[**internally valid**](#def:InternalValidity)
if the study was well designed.


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityDeer name="Statistical validity"}
For the red deer data,
the scatterplot
(Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter))
shows that the relationship is approximately linear,
and the variation in molar weights doesn't seem to be 
obviously getting larger or smaller for older deer,
so correlations are sensible.
The sample size is also greater than 25.

The test in Sect. \@ref(CorrelationTesting) will be statistically valid.

::: {.example #StatisticalValidityBiomass name="Statistical validity"}
A study
[@data:ForestBiomass2017; @mypapers:dunnsmyth:glms]
examined  the foliage biomass of small-leaved lime trees.
A plot of the foliage biomass against diameter
(Fig. \@ref(fig:LimeScatter))
shows that the relationship is non-linear.
In addition,
the variation in foliage biomass *increases* for larger diameters
(for values of $x$ near 10, the values of $y$ do not vary much at all, 
but for values of $x$ near 30, the values of $y$ vary greatly). 

Both of these issues mean that correlations are not appropriate.
A hypothesis test similar to that in 
Sect. \@ref(CorrelationTesting) 
is inappropriate.

::: {.example #CorTestDogs name="Phu Quoc ridgeback dogs"}
A study of Phu Quoc Ridgeback dogs (*Canis familiaris*)
recorded many measurements of the dogs, including body length and body height [@quan2017relation].

The scatterplot (Fig. \@ref(fig:DogsScatter))
shows an approximate linear relationship.
We know that each sample could produce a different sample correlation coefficient.
We expect that taller dogs would also be longer, so we may ask:

> For these dogs,
> are longer dogs also taller dogs, in general?
  
The hypotheses are:
  
* $H_0$: $\rho = 0$
* $H_1$: $\rho > 0$ (i.e., one-tailed)


The correlation co-efficient is $r = 0.837$ and software notes that the two-tailed $P < 0.001$,
based on $n = 30$ dogs.

We write:

> There is very strong evidence that longer Phu Quoc ridgeback dogs are also taller ($r = 0.837$; one-tailed $P<0.001$; $n = 30$).

Since 
(a) the sample size is larger than 25; 
(b) the relationship is approximately linear; *and* 
(c) the variation in heights do not seem to differ for different lengths, the test is statistically valid.

* $H_1$: $\rho \ne 0$

The correlation co-efficient is given as  $r = 0.346$ and $P = 0.18$.


No scatterplot is provided, so the test is statistically valid only if the relationship is approximately linear

In wastewater treatment facilities,
air from biofiltration is passed through a membrane and dissolved in water,
and is transformed into harmless byproducts.
The removal efficiency $y$ (in %)
may depend on the inlet temperature (in $^\circ$C; $x$).

The RQ is

> In treating biofiltation wastewater,
> is the removal efficiency associated with the inlet temperature?

The population parameter is $\rho$,
the correlation between the removal efficiency and inlet temperature.

A scatterplot of $n=32$ samples
(Fig. \@ref(fig:CorrelationRemovalEfficiency))
suggests an approximately linear relationship
[@chitwood2001treatment; @DevoreBerk2007].

The output 
(jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencyjamovi);
SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencySPSS))
shows that the sample correlation coefficient is $r=0.891$, 
and so $R^2 = (0.891)^2 = 79.4$%.
This means that about 79.4% of the variation in removal efficiency can be explained 
by knowing the inlet temperature.



```{r CorrelationRemovalEfficiency, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The relationship between removal efficiency and inlet temperature", fig.align="center", fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}

     xlab = "Temperature (degrees C)",
     ylab = "Removal efficiency (%)",
     pch = 19,
     las = 1
     )
```



To test if a relationship exists in the population, 
write:

* $H_0$: $\rho = 0$;
* $H_1$: $\rho \ne 0$: Two-tailed (as implied by the RQ).

The software output 
(jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencyjamovi);
SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencySPSS))
shows that $P < 0.001$ (which is what $P = 0.000$ in SPSS means).
We conclude:

> The sample presents very strong evidence (two-tailed $P < 0.001$)
> that removal efficiency depends on the inlet temperature ($r = 0.891$; $n = 32$)
> in the population.

The relationship is approximately linear and there is no obvious non-constant variance, 
and the sample size is larger than 25,
so the hypothesis test results will be statistically valid.

## Summary {#Chap34-Summary}

In this chapter,
**correlation** was used to
describe the *strength* and direction of *linear* relationships
between two *quantitative* variables.

**Correlation coefficients**
(denoted $r$ in the sample; $\rho$ in the population)
are always between $-1$ and $+1$.

*Positive* values denote *positive* relationships between the two variables:
as one values gets larger, the other tends to get larger too.

*Negative* values denote *negative* relationships between the two variables:
as one values gets larger, the other tends to get *smaller*.
Values close to $-1$ or $+1$ are very strong relationships;
values near zero shows very little linear relationship between the variables.
Hypothesis tests for $r$ can be conducted using software.

Sometimes,
$R^2$ is used to describe the relationship:
it indicates what percentage of the variation in the response variable
can be explained by knowing the value of the explanatory variables.

## Quick review questions {#Chap34-QuickReview}

A study of Chinese paedatric patients
[@wong2018correlation]
studied the relationship between the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD)
and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2~max~)
for $n= 2 9$ patients.

The correlation coefficient is reported as $r = 0.457$,
and the corresponding $P$-value as $P = 0.013$.

1. The $x$-variable is  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
  answer = "6-minute walk distance",
  "Maximum oxygen uptake"
) )}`
1. True or false: Since the $P$-value is small, the correlation must be quite strong.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer=FALSE)}`
1. The relationship is best described as  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
  "Negative",
  answer = "Positive"
) )}`
1. The value of $R^2$ (to one decimal place, expressed as a percentage) is:  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {fitb(answer = 20.9, num=TRUE, tol=0.1)}`
1. For statistical validity, we need to *assume* that:  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
  "The response variable has a normal distribution",
  "The explanatory variable has a normal distribution",
  "The sample size is larger than 25",
  answer = "A linear relationship exists between the variables"
) )}`

**Progress:** `r webexercises::total_correct()`

   What is the value of $r$? (Hint: Be careful!)
1. Would you expect the $P$-value testing $H_0$: $\rho=0$ to be small or large? 
   Explain.
1. Would the test be statistically valid?
