**1.** Observational: researchers cannot determine *comparison* (not outcome).
**2.** Mix of both C ('smokers and non-smokers') and O ('median serum cholesterol').
**3.** External validity refers to whether sample represents target population (Australians). Whether results apply for entire world is irrelevant.
**4.** 'Serum cholesterol' not a variable; nothing varies. 
Variable is 'serum cholesterol concentration'.
**5.** Not an experiment.
**6.** Data file needs $2$\ columns (variables): one records smoking status (Yes/No), one records serum cholesterol concentration.
**7.** Confounder must be related to *both* response and explanatory variables.
