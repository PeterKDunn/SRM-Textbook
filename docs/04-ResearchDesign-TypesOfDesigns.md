## Introduction

Chapter\ \@ref(RQs) introduced four types of research questions: descriptive, relational, repeated-measures and correlational.
This chapter discusses the types of research studies needed to answer these RQs, while Chaps.\ \@ref(Ethics) to\ \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures) discuss the details of designing these studies and collecting the data.

Different types of studies can be used to collect the data needed to answer RQs:

* *descriptive* studies (Sect.\ \@ref(DescriptiveStudies)) answer descriptive RQs.
* *observational* studies (Sect.\ \@ref(ObservationalStudies)) answer RQs with an explanatory variable, but *no intervention*.\index{Intervention}
* *experimental* studies (Sect.\ \@ref(ExperimentalStudies)) answer RQs with an explanatory variable and *an intervention*.

Observational and experimental studies are sometimes collectively called *analytical studies*.\index{Study types!analytical}


## Descriptive studies {#DescriptiveStudies}
\index{Research question!descriptive}\index{Study types!descriptive}


::: {.definition #DescriptiveStudy name="Descriptive study"}
*Descriptive studies* answer descriptive RQs.
:::


Descriptive studies are not explicitly studied further, as the relevant ideas are present in the discussion of observational and experimental studies.


::: {.example #DescriptiveStudy name="Descriptive study"}
@lee2020practice studied the percentage of people in Hong Kong wearing face masks in various situations.
A descriptive RQ is being asked: the population is 'residents of Hong Kong', and the outcome is (for example) 'the percentage who wear face masks when taking care of family members with fever'.
Answering this RQ requires a *descriptive study*.
:::


## Observational studies {#ObservationalStudies}
\index{Research question!relational}\index{Research question!repeated-measures}\index{Research question!correlational}\index{Study types!observational}

*Observational studies* are used for RQs with no intervention.
They are commonly-used, and sometimes are the only type of research design possible.
Observational studies do not have an intervention, and hence have *conditions*\index{Conditions} (Def.\ \@ref(def:Conditions)) rather than *treatments*.\index{Treatments}


::: {.definition #ObservationalStudy name="Observational study"}
*Observational studies* study relationships *without* an intervention.

::: {.example #ObservationalRelationalEchinacea name="Between-individuals observational study"}
Consider again this one-tailed, decision-making RQ (based on the ideas in Sect.\ \@ref(Writing-RQs)):

> Among Australian teenagers with a common cold, is the average duration of cold symptoms *shorter* for teens taking a daily dose of echinacea compared to teens taking no medication?

This RQ has a *between-individuals* comparison\index{Comparison!within individuals}, so is a relational RQ.\spacex
If the researchers *do not* impose the taking of echinacea (that is, the individuals make this decision themselves), the study is observational.
The two *conditions*\index{Conditions} are 'taking echinacea', and 'not taking echinacea' (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImageBetween)).

::: {.example #ResearchDesignWeightLoss name="Within-individuals observational study"}
@levitsky2004freshman recorded the weights of university students at the beginning of university, and then after $12$ weeks from the same students.
The comparison is *within* individuals; this is a *repeated-measures* (paired) RQ.\xspace\index{Data!paired}\index{Study types!paired}
Since the researchers do not impose anything on the students, there is *no intervention* (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImageWithin)).

The *outcome* is the average weight.
The *response variable* is the weight of individuals.
The *within-individuals comparison*\index{Comparison!within individuals} is the week of the university semester ($1$ and\ $12$).

@poovaragavan2023estimation explored the relationship between time since death, and the concentration of sodium in synovial (knee) fluid.
This is a correlational RQ as groups are not being compared.
The time since death is the explanatory variable, and the concentration of sodium in synovial fluid is the response variable.
The researchers do not impose the time since death, so there is *no intervention* (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImageCorrelational)).

## Experimental studies {#ExperimentalStudies}
\index{Research question!relational}\index{Research question!repeated-measures}\index{Research question!correlational}\index{Study types!experimental}

*Experimental studies*, or *experiments*, are used for RQs with an intervention, and are commonly-used.
Well-designed experimental studies can establish a *cause-and-effect relationship* between the response and explanatory variables.
However, using experimental studies is not always possible.
In general, well-designed experimental studies are more likely to be internally valid than observational studies.
Experimental studies have an intervention, and hence *treatments* (Def.\ \@ref(def:Treatments)). 

::: {.definition #Experiment name="Experiment"}
*Experimental studies* (or *experiments*) study relationships *with* an intervention.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
In an *experimental study*, the unit of analysis (Def.\ \@ref(def:UnitOfAnalysis)) is the smallest collection of units of observations that can be randomly allocated to separate treatments.
:::


::: {.example #ResearchDesignWalk400m name="Within-individuals experimental study"}
Consider this RQ:

> For obese men over\ $60$ years-of-age, what is the average increase in heart rate after walking $400\ms$?

This RQ uses a *within-individuals comparison* (before and after walking $400\ms$) so is a repeated-measures (and paired) RQ.\spacex
The study has an intervention if researchers impose the $400\ms$ walk on the subjects (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ExpStudiesImageWithin)).
The *outcome* is the average heart rate.
The *response variable* is the heart rate for each individual man.

::: {.example #ResearchDesignLeafDrip name="Correlational experimental study"}
@xu2023design studied leaf-drip irrigation, exploring the relationship between the water pressure and flow rate.
This is a correlational RQ, where the hydraulic pressure time is the explanatory variable, and the flow rate is the response variable.
The researchers imposed nine different values for water pressure, so there is an intervention (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImageCorrelationalintervention)).

### True experimental studies {#TrueExperiments}
\index{Study types!experimental!true}

*True experiments* are commonly used to answer relational RQs.
An example of a true experiment is a *randomised controlled trial*, often used in drug trials.


::: {.definition #TrueExperiment name="True experiment"}
In a *true experiment*, the researchers:

1. allocate treatments to groups of individuals (i.e., allocate the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals), *and*
2. determine who or what individuals are in those groups.

While the steps may not happen *explicit*, they happen *conceptually*.
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3807629.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>



::: {.example name="True experiment"}
The echinacea study (Sect.\ \@ref(Writing-RQs)) could be designed as a *true experiment*.
The researchers would allocate individuals to one of two groups, and then decide which group took echinacea and which group did not (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TrueExpStudiesImage)).

These steps may happen implicitly: researchers may allocate each person at random to one of the two groups (echinacea; no echinacea).
This is still a true experiment, since the researchers could decide to switch which group receives echinacea; ultimately, the decision is still made by the researchers.
:::


<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="04-ResearchDesign-TypesOfDesigns_files/figure-html/TrueExpStudiesImage-1.png" alt="True experimental studies: researchers allocate individuals to groups, and treatments to groups." width="65%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:TrueExpStudiesImage)True experimental studies: researchers allocate individuals to groups, and treatments to groups.</p>
</div>




### Quasi-experimental studies {#QuasiExperiments}
\index{Study types!experimental!quasi}

Quasi-experiments are similar to true experiments (i.e., answer relational RQs)  but treatments are *allocated* to groups that *already exist* (e.g., may be naturally occurring).


::: {.definition #QuasiExperiment name="Quasi-experiment"}
In a *quasi-experiment*, the researchers:
  
1. allocate treatments to groups of individuals (i.e., allocate the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals), but
2. do *not* determine who or what individuals are in those groups.
:::
      

::: {.example #QuasiEchinacea name="Quasi-experiments"}
The echinacea study (Sect.\ \@ref(Writing-RQs)) could be designed as a quasi-experiment.
The researchers could *find* two existing groups of people (say, from Suburbs\ A and\ B), then decide to allocate people in Suburb\ A to take echinacea, and people in Suburb\ B to *not* take echinacea (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:QuasiExpStudiesImage)).
:::


<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="04-ResearchDesign-TypesOfDesigns_files/figure-html/QuasiExpStudiesImage-1.png" alt="Quasi-experimental studies: researchers do not allocate individuals to groups, but do allocate treatments to groups. The dashed lines indicate steps not under the control of the researchers." width="65%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:QuasiExpStudiesImage)Quasi-experimental studies: researchers do not allocate individuals to groups, but do allocate treatments to groups. The dashed lines indicate steps not under the control of the researchers.</p>
</div>


::: {.example #QuasiAlcoholAwareness name="Quasi-experiments"}
A researcher wants to examine the effect of an alcohol awareness program (based on @macdonald2008enough) on the average amount of alcohol consumed per student in a university Orientation Week.
She runs the program at University A only, then compares the average amount of alcohol consumed per person at two universities (A and\ B).

This study is a *quasi-experiment* since the researcher did not (and can not) determine the groups: the students (not the researcher) would have chosen University\ A or University\ B for many reasons.
However, the researcher *did* decide whether to allocate the program to University\ A or University\ B.
:::



## Comparing study types {#CompareStudyTypes}
\index{Study types!compared}

In *experimental* studies, researchers *create* differences in the values of the explanatory variable through allocation, and then note the effect this has on the values of the response variable.
In *observational* studies, researchers *observe* differences in the values of the explanatory variable, and observe the values of the response variable.

Importantly, *only well-designed true experiments can show cause-and-effect*.
Nonetheless, well-designed observational and quasi-experimental studies can provide evidence to *support* cause-and-effect conclusions, especially when supported by other evidence.
Although only true experimental studies can show cause-and-effect, true experimental studies are often not possible for ethical, financial, practical and/or logistical reasons.

The advantages and disadvantages of each study type are discussed later (Sect.\ \@ref(InterpretStudyDesign)), after these study types are discussed in greater detail in the following chapters.

::: {.example #Autism name="Cause and effect"}
Many studies report that the bacteria in the gut of people on the autism spectrum is different from the bacteria in the gut of people *not* on the autism spectrum [@kang2019long; @ho2020gut], and suggest the bacteria may contribute whether a person is autistic.
These studies were observational, so the\index{Cause and effect}
[suggestion of a cause-and-effect relationship may be inaccurate](https://theconversation.com/gut-bacteria-dont-cause-autism-autistic-kids-microbiome-differences-are-due-to-picky-eating-170366).

Other studies [@yap2021autism] suggest that people on the autism spectrum are more likely to be 'picky eaters', which contributes to the differences in gut bacteria.

## Directionality in research studies {#Directionality}
\index{Study types!directionality}

Analytical research studies (observational; experimental) can be classified by their *directionality* (Table\ \@ref(tab:TypesOfObsStudies)).\index{Study types!analytical}

* *Forward direction* (Sect.\ \@ref(Forward)): 
  the values of the explanatory variable are obtained, and the study determines what values of the response variable occur in the future.
  *All experimental studies have a forward direction.*
* *Backward direction* (Sect.\ \@ref(Backward)): 
  the values of the response variable are obtained, then the study determines what values of the explanatory variable occurred in the past.
* *No direction* (Sect.\ \@ref(NonDirectional)): 
  the values of the response and explanatory variables are obtained at the same time.

Directionality is important for understanding cause-and-effect relationships.
If the explanatory variable occurs *before* the outcome is observed, a cause-and-effect relationship *may* be possible.
That is, studies with a forward direction are more likely to provide evidence of causality.

::: {.example name="Directionality" #BackwardStudy}
In South Australia in 1988--1989, $25$\ cases of legionella infections (an unusually high number) were investigated.
All $25$\ cases were gardeners.

@data:oconnor:pottingmix compared $25$\ people with legionella infections with $75$ similar people without the infection, and found that recent (past) use of potting mix was associated with an increase in the risk of contracting illness.

This study has a backward *direction*: people were identified with an infection, and then the researchers looked *back* at past activities.
:::




<iframe src="https://learningapps.org/watch?v=p3i692osc22" style="border:0px;width:100%;height:500px" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>


Research studies are sometimes described as 'prospective'\index{Study types!prospective} or 'retrospective',\index{Study types!prospective} but these terms can be misleading [@ranganathan2018study] and their use not recommended [@VANDENBROUCKE20141500].


*Experimental studies always have a forward direction.*
Observational studies may have any directionality, and may be given different names accordingly.


### Forward-directional studies {#Forward}
\index{Study types!directionality!forward}

All experimental studies have a forward direction, and include *randomised controlled trials* (RCTs) and *clinical trials*.\index{Clinical trials}\index{Randomised controlled trials}

Observational studies with a *forward* direction are often called *cohort studies*.\index{Study types!directionality!forward}\index{Study types!cohort studies}
Both experimental studies and cohort studies can be expensive and tricky: tracking individuals (a *cohort*) into the future is not always easy, and the ability to track some individuals into the future may be lost (*drop-outs*):\index{Drop outs} plants or animals may die, people may move or decide to no longer participate, etc.
Forward-directional observational studies:

* may add support to cause-and-effect conclusions, since the comparison occurs *before* the outcome (only well-designed experimental studies can establish cause-and-effect).
* can examine many outcomes in one study, since the outcome(s) occur in the future. 
* can be problematic for rare outcomes, as the outcome of interest may never (or rarely) appear in the future.



::: {.example name="Forward study"}
@chih2018incidence studied dogs and cats who had been recommended to receive intermittent nasogastric tube (NGT) aspiration for up to\ $36\hs$.
Some pet owners did not give permission for NGT, while some did; thus, whether the animal received NGT was *not* determined by the researchers (the study is observational).
The researchers then observed whether the animals developed hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (HCMA) in the next $36\hs$.

Since the explanatory variable (whether NGT was used) was recorded at the start of the study, and the response variable (whether HCMA was observed) was determined within the following $36\hs$, this study has a *forward direction*.
:::


### Backward-directional studies {#Backward}
\index{Study types!directionality!backward}

Observational studies with a *backward* direction are often called *case-control* studies.\index{Study types!directionality!backward}\index{Study types!case-control studies}
The 'cases' are often individuals with a certain disease, and then the controls are those without the disease (see Example\ \@ref(exm:BackwardStudy)).
Researchers find individuals with specific values of the response variable (cases and controls), and determine values of the explanatory variable from the past.
Case-control studies:

* only allow one outcome to be studied, since individuals are chosen to be in the study based on the value of the response variable of interest.
* are useful for rare outcomes, as the researchers can purposely select large numbers with the rare outcome of interest.
* do not effectively eliminate other explanations for the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (*confounding*; Def.\ \@ref(def:Confounding)).
* may suffer from *selection bias* (Sect.\ \@ref(SelectionBias)), as researchers purposively try to locate individuals with a rare outcome.\index{Bias!selection}
* may suffer from *recall bias* (Sect.\ \@ref(Biases)) when the individuals are people: accurately recalling the past can be unreliable.\index{Bias!recall}

::: {.example name="Backwards study"}
@data:Pamphlett:toxins examined patients with and without sporadic motor neurone disease (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">smnd</span>), and asked about *past* exposure to metals.

The response variable (whether the respondent had <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">smnd</span>) is assessed when the study begins, and whether subjects had exposure to metals (explanatory variable) is determined from the *past*.
This observational study has a *backward* direction.
:::


### Non-directional studies {#NonDirectional}
\index{Study types!directionality!non-directional}

*Non-directional* observational studies are called *cross-sectional* studies.\index{Study types!directionality!non-directional}\index{Study types!cross-sectional studies}
Cross-sectional studies:

* are good for findings associations between variables (and these associations may or may not be causation).
* are generally quicker and cheaper to conduct than other types of studies.
* are not useful for studying rare outcomes.
* do not effectively eliminate other explanations for the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (*confounding*; Def.\ \@ref(def:Confounding)).


::: {.example name="Non-directional study"}
@data:Russell2014:FoodInsecurity asked older Australian their opinions of their own food security, and recorded their living arrangements.
Individuals' responses to both the response variable and explanatory variable were gathered at the same time.
This observational study is *non-directional*.
:::



## The role of research design {#DesignImportance}

Choosing the *type* of study is only one part of research design; many other decisions must be made also.
The purpose of these decisions is to ensure researchers can confidently study the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (*internal validity*) in the population of interest (*external validity*) from studying one the many possible samples.
This is related to the idea of *bias*.\index{Bias}


::: {.definition #Bias name="Bias"}
*Bias* refers to any systematic misrepresentation of the target population or a parameter caused by the sampling or the study design.
:::


Various types of bias are possible, some of which are studied later.
Maximising internal and external validity reduces bias.
Bias may occur during research design, sample selection (Sect.\ \@ref(SelectionBias)), data collection (selection bias; Sect.\ \@ref(def:SelectionBias)), analysis, or interpretation of results (Chap.\ \@ref(Interpretation)).
This book only discusses some possible biases.

Designing a study to maximise *internal validity* means:

* identifying *what else* might influence the values of the response variable, apart from the explanatory variable (Chap.\ \@ref(ResearchDesignOverview)).
* designing the study to be *effective* (Chap.\ \@ref(DesignInternal)).

In general, experimental studies have better internal validity than observational studies.

Designing a study to maximise *external validity* means:

* identifying who or what to study, since the whole population cannot be studied (Chap.\ \@ref(Sampling)).
* determining *how many* individuals to study.
  (We need to learn more before we can answer this critical question in Chap.\ \@ref(EstimatingSampleSize).)

Details of the data *collection* (Chap.\ \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures)) and *ethical* issues (Chap.\ \@ref(Ethics)) also form part of the study design.


The following short (humourous) video demonstrates the importance of understanding the design!

## Chapter summary {#Chap3-Summary}

Three types of research studies are: *descriptive studies* (for studying descriptive RQs), *observational studies* (for studying relationships *without* an intervention), and *experimental* (for studying relationships *with* an intervention).

Observational studies can be classified as having a *forward direction* (cohort studies), *backward direction* (case-control studies), or *no direction* (cross-sectional studies).
Experimental studies always have a forward direction.
Relational RQs with an intervention can be classified as *true experiments* or *quasi-experiments*.
Cause-and-effect conclusions can only be made from well-designed *true experiments*.

Ideally studies should be designed to be *internally* and *externally* valid.
In general, experimental studies have better internal validity than observational studies.

:::{.exercise #TypesOfDesignsAcuteOtitis}
Consider this RQ [@data:McLinn:otitis]:

> In children with acute otitis media, what is the difference in the average duration of symptoms when treated with cefuroxime compared to amoxicillin?

1. Is the comparison a within- or between-individuals comparison?
1. Is this RQ descriptive, relational, repeated-measures or correlational?
1. Is there likely an intervention?
1. Is the RQ an estimation or decision-making RQ?
1. Is the study observational or experimental?
   If observational, what is the *direction*?
   If experimental, is this a quasi-experiment or true experiment?
:::


::: {.exercise #TypesOfDesignsWorms}
@data:Khair2015:Earthworms studied the time needed for organic waste to turn into compost.
For some batches of compost, earthworms were added.
In other batches, earthworms were *not* added to the waste.
One RQ asked whether the composting times for waste with and without earthworms was the same or not. 

1. Is the comparison a within- or between-individuals comparison?
1. Is this RQ descriptive, relational, repeated-measures or correlational?
1. Is there an intervention?
1. Is the RQ an estimation or decision-making RQ?
1. Is the study observational or experimental?
   If observational, what is the *direction*?
   If experimental, is this a quasi-experiment or true experiment?

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignConcreteBeams}
@gonzalez2007shear studied recycled concrete beams.
Beams were divided into three groups, different loads were then applied to each group, then the shear strength needed to fracture the beams was measured.
Is this a *quasi-experiment* or a *true experiment*? 
Explain.
:::


::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignVAP}
A research study compared the use of two different education programs to reduce the percentage of patients experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Paramedics from two cities were chosen to participate. 
Paramedics in City\ A were allocated to receive Program\ 1, and paramedics in the other city to receive Program\ 2.

1. Is this RQ descriptive, relational, repeated-measures or correlational?
1. Is the comparison a within- or between-individuals comparison?
1. Is there likely an intervention?
1. Is the study observational or experimental?
   If observational, what is the *direction*?
   If experimental, is this a quasi-experiment or true experiment?
:::



::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignMatresses}
@data:Manzano2013:Matresses compared 'the effectiveness of alternating pressure air mattresses vs. overlays, to prevent pressure ulcers' (p.\ $2\,099$).
Patients were *provided* with alternating pressure air overlays (in 2001) or alternating pressure air mattresses (in 2006).
The number of pressure ulcers were recorded.

This study is experimental, because the researchers *provided* the mattresses.
Is this a *true* experiment or *quasi*-experiment?
Explain.
:::


::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignDietsForWeightLoss}
@data:sacks:weightloss compared four weight-loss diets, using $811$ overweight adults each randomly assigned to one diet.
The diets used comparable foods.
The authors state (p.\ 859):

> The primary outcome was the change in body weight after $2$\ years in [...] comparisons of low fat versus high fat and average protein versus high protein and in the comparison of highest and lowest carbohydrate content.
