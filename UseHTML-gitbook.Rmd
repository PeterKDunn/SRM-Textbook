The book is optimised for *online viewing*, and the book may be updated frequently, so a printed PDF version may not be the most recent version.

In some places, interactive 'quiz' questions are given.
*In the online version*, the background turns from red to green when the answer is correct.
Try it now:

`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c("One", answer="Two", "Three") )}`
1. What is $1 + 2$?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {fitb( answer= c("3", "three"), ignore_case=TRUE )}`
