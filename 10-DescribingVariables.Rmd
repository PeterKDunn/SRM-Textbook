## Introduction {#Describing-Intro}

Understanding the *type* of data collected is essential before starting any summarising or analysis, because the *type* of data determines how to proceed.
Broadly, data may be classified as either *quantitative* data (Sect.\ \@ref(QuantData)) or *qualitative* data (Sect.\ \@ref(QualData)).
The *data* are the recorded *values* of the variables, so we also talk about quantitative and qualitative *variables*.
Quantitative variables record quantitative data; qualitative variables record qualitative data.


::: {.example #VariablesData name="Variables and data"}
'Age' is a *variable* because age varies from individual to individual (Def.\ \@ref(def:Variable)).
The *data* may include values like $13$\ months, $21$\ years and $76$\ years.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
*Quantitative research* summarises and analyses data using numerical methods (Sect.\ \@ref(TypesOfResearch)).
*Quantitative research* can involve both *quantitative* and *qualitative* data, because both can be summarised numerically (Chaps.\ \@ref(SummariseQuantData) and\ \@ref(SummariseQualData) respectively) and analysed numerically.
:::


## Quantitative data: discrete and continuous data {#QuantData}
\index{Quantitative data|(}

*Quantitative* data are *mathematically* numerical.
Most data arising from counting or measuring is quantitative. 
Quantitative data often (but not always) have measurement units (such as\ *kg* or\ *cm*).
Be careful: numerical data are not necessarily quantitative.
Only *mathematically* numerical data are quantitative; that is, numbers with numerical *meanings*.

</div>


::: {.definition #QuantitativeData name="Quantitative data"}
*Quantitative data* is *mathematically* numerical: the numbers have numerical meaning, and represent quantities or amounts.
Quantitative data generally arise from counting or measuring.

</div>


::: {.example #QuantitativePostcodes name="Quantitative data"}
The weight of numbats, the thickness of sheet metal, and blood pressure are all *measured*, and are quantitative variables.

The number of power failures per year, the number of solar panels per home, and the number of tangelos per tree are all *counts*, and are quantitative variables. 

Australian postcodes are four-digit numbers, but are *not* quantitative; the numbers are labels.
A postcode of\ 4556 isn't one 'better' or 'more' than a postcode of\ 4555.
The values do not have numerical *meanings*.
Indeed, alphabetic postcodes could have been chosen.
For example, the postcode of Caboolture (Queensland) is\ 4510, but could have been\ QCAB.
:::


Quantitative data may be further classified as *discrete* or *continuous*.\index{Quantitative data!discrete}
*Discrete* quantitative data have possible values that can be counted, at least in theory.
Sometimes, the possible values may have no theoretical upper limit, yet are still considered 'countable'.
*Continuous* quantitative data have values that cannot, at least in theory, be recorded exactly: another value can always be found between any two given values of the variable, if we measure to a greater number of decimal places.
In practice, though, values must be rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places.


::: {.definition #DiscreteData name="Discrete data"}
\index{Quantitative data!discrete}\index{Variables!discrete quantitative}
*Discrete* quantitative data has a countable number of possible values between any two given values of the variable.
:::


::: {.example #QuantDiscrete name="Discrete quantitative data"}
These quantitative variables are *discrete*:

* The *number* of heart attacks in the previous year experienced by Croatian women over $40$.
  Possible values: $0$,\ $1$,\ $2$,\ $\dots$
* The *number* of cracked eggs in a carton of\ $12$.
  Possible values: $0$,\ $1$, $2$, $\dots$\ $12$.
* The *number* of orthotic devices a person has used.
  Possible values: $0$,\ $1$, $2$,\ $\dots$ 
* The *number* of turbine cracks after $750$\ hours use.
  Possible values: $0$,\ $1$, $2$,\ $\dots$
:::



::: {.definition #ContinuousData name="Continuous data"}
\index{Quantitative data!continuous}\index{Variables!continuous quantitative}
*Continuous* quantitative data have (at least in theory) an infinite number of possible values between any two given values.
:::

Height is continuous: between the heights of\ $179$\cms and\ $180$\cms, many heights exist, depending on how many decimal places are used to record height.
In practice, however, heights are usually rounded to the nearest centimetre for convenience.
All continuous data are rounded.


::: {.example #QuantContinuous name="Continuous quantitative data"}
These quantitative variables are *continuous*:

* The *weight* of $6$-year-old Fijian children.
  Values exist between any two given values of weight, by measuring to more decimal places of a kilogram.
  However, weights are usually reported to the nearest kilogram.
* The *energy consumption* of houses in London.
  Values exist between any two given values of energy consumption, by measuring to more and more decimal places of a kiloWatt-hour (kWh).
  Consumption would usually be given to the nearest\ kWh.
* The *time* spent in front of a computer each day for employees in a given industry.
  Values exist between any two given times, by measuring to more decimal places of a second.
  The values may be reported to the nearest minute, or the nearest\ $15$\mins.
:::


Sometimes, discrete quantitative data with a very large number of possible values may be treated as continuous.


:::{.example #DiscreteAsContinuous name="Treating discrete data as continuous"}
Annual income is discrete, since no income is between \$$80\,000.00$ and \$$80\,000.01$.
However, annual incomes are usually much larger than cents, and vary at scales much greater than cents, and so are usually treated as continuous data.

## Qualitative data: nominal and ordinal data {#QualData}
\index{Qualitative data|(}

*Qualitative* data has distinct labels or categories, and are not mathematically numerical.
Be careful: *numerical* data may be qualitative if those numbers don't have numerical *meanings*.
The categories of a qualitative variable are called the *levels* or the *values* of the variable.

      
<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-construction-35-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #QualitativeData name="Qualitative data"}
*Qualitative data* are not *mathematically* numerical data: they comprises mutually exclusive, exhaustive categories or labels.\index{Mutually exclusive}\index{Exhaustive}
:::


::: {.definition #Levels name="Levels"}
\index{Qualitative data!levels}\index{Levels}
The *levels* (or the *values*) of a qualitative variable refer to the names of the distinct categories. 
:::


::: {.example #QualData name="Qualitative data"}
'Brand of mobile phone' is qualitative.
Many levels (i.e., brands) are possible, but could be simplified by using the levels as 'Apple', 'Samsung', 'Google' and 'Other'.
:::


      
::: {.example #QualData2 name="Qualitative data"}
Social Security Numbers (SSN) in the US are nine-digit numbers unique to each individual.
The first three digits represent geographic regions; the next two digits are assigned to groups in that region.
The last four digits are unique to individuals.

The SSN may be a nine-digit number, but SSN is qualitative.
:::


::: {.example #DefinitionsClarity name="Clarity in variables"}
'Age' is a *continuous quantitative* variable, since age could be measured to many decimal places of a second.
Age is usually rounded down to the number of completed years, for convenience.
However, the age of young children may be given as '$3$\ days' or '$10$\ months'.

Sometimes *Age group* is used (such as Under\ $20$; $20$ to under\ $50$; $50$\ or over) instead of Age.
'Age group' is *qualitative*.

Ensure you are clear about which is used!
:::


::: {.example #DefinitionsLevels name="Levels"}
The levels of a variable depend on how the variable is defined.
For example, the variable 'How people commute to work' may have two levels: 'Using public transport' and 'Not using public transport'.

An alternative way of recording the same information is to define the variable as 'Whether people use public transport to commute to work'.
For this variable, the levels are 'Yes' and 'No'.
:::


Qualitative data can be further classified as *nominal* or *ordinal*.


::: {.definition #Nominal name="Nominal qualitative variables"}
\index{Qualitative data!nominal}\index{Variables!nominal qualitative}
A *nominal* qualitative variable is a qualitative variable where the levels *do not* have a natural order. 
:::


::: {.definition #Ordinal name="Ordinal qualitative variables"}
\index{Qualitative data!ordinal}\index{Variables!ordinal qualitative}
An *ordinal* qualitative variable is a qualitative variable where the levels *do* have a natural order. 
:::

::: {.example #NominalOrdinal name="Nominal and ordinal data"} 
*Blood type* is qualitative with four levels: Type\ A; Type\ B; Type\ AB; Type\ O.\spacex
These levels have no natural order; they can be ordered alphabetically, or by prevalence.
*Blood type* is nominal.

*Age group* could be listed with levels Under\ $20$; $20$\ to under $50$; $50$\ or over.
These levels have a natural order: youngest to oldest.
*Age group* is ordinal.
:::


::: {.example #OrdinalData name="Ordinal data"}
Consider this questionnaire question:

> Please indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with this statement:
> 'Vaping should be banned'.

Respondents can select one of these options: 
Strongly disagree; Disagree; Neither agree or disagree; Agree; Strongly agree.

The responses will be *ordinal* with five levels.
Giving the levels in the given order (or the reverse order) makes sense; giving the levels in alphabetical order, for example, would be very confusing.

</div>


::: {.example #TypesVariables name="Types of variables"}
Consider a study to determine if the weight of $500$\ g bags of pasta really weigh\ $500$\gs (or more) in general.
One approach is to record the weight of pasta in each bag (a *quantitative* variable), and compare the *average* weight to the target weight of $500$\gs.

Another approach is to record whether each bag of pasta was underweight or not using a balance scale.
This variable would be *qualitative*, with two *levels* (underweight; not underweight).
The *percentage* of underweight bags could be reported.

## Chapter summary {#Describing-Summary}

The *type* of data collected determines the types of summaries and analyses that are needed.
Data and variables can be classified as either:

* *quantitative* (*discrete* or *continuous*) if mathematically numerical; or
* *qualitative* (*nominal* or *ordinal*) if not mathematically numerical.

@benetou2020diet studied school-aged adolescents in Greece.
Among other variables, for each child they recorded the body-mass index (weight, divided by height-squared), diet quality (poor; moderate; good), the region where they lived (Attica; Thessaloniki; Other), the number of days they performed physical exercise in the last week, and school grade.

The data in Table\ \@ref(tab:DescribeAnkleFoot) give the data for the $15$ subjects.
(GMFCS is the 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Gross Motor Function Classification System)'
} else {
   '[Gross Motor Function Classification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_Motor_Function_Classification_System))'
}`
used to describe the impact of cerebral palsy on their motor function; where *lower* levels mean *better* functionality.)
Classify the variables in the study using the language of this chapter.

::: {.exercise #DescribeClassifyingNitrogenInSoil}
@data:Lane2002:GLMsoilscience studied fertilizer use, and recorded the soil nitrogen after applying different fertilizer doses.
These variables were recorded for each field:

1. the *fertilizer dose*, in kilograms of nitrogen per hectare; 
2. the *soil nitrogen*, in kilograms of nitrogen per hectare; and
3. the *fertilizer source*; one of 'inorganic' or 'organic'.

Classify the variables in the study.

::: {.exercise #DescribeClassifyingKangaroos}
@brunton2019fright recorded the response of kangaroos to overhead drones (one of 'No vigilance', 'Vigilance', 'Flee\ $<10$\ms', or 'Flee\ $>10$\ms') and the altitude of the drone ($30$\ms, $60$\ms, $100$\ms or\ $120$\ms).
The mob size and sex of the kangaroo was also recorded.

::: {.exercise #DescribeSelfieDeaths}
@data:Dokur2018:SelfieDeaths studied people who died while taking selfies, and recorded the data in Table\ \@ref(tab:TableSelfieDeaths).
Which of the following are the *variables* in the table?
For each that is a variable, classify the variable.

1. The location.
1. The number of people who died at each location.
1. The percentage of people who died at each location.
