So far, you have learnt how to ask a RQ.

**In this chapter**,
you will study the details of *how to design* a method for collecting the data needed to answer the RQ.
You will learn to:

* design scientifically sound studies to answer simple quantitative research questions.
* design ethical studies.
* describe the various types of quantitative research studies.
* compare and contrast experimental and observational studies.
* describe and identify retrospective, prospective and cross-sectional observational studies.
* describe and identify true experimental and quasi-experimental studies.
* explain external and internal validity.

## Three types of study designs {#Three-Research-Designs}

From the RQ,
we know what data *must* be collected 
from the individuals in the study
(the response and explanatory variables)...
but *how* do we design a study to obtain this data?
After all,
data are important:
they are the means by which the RQ is answered.

Three broad methods for obtaining data are to use:

* Descriptive studies (Sect. \@ref(DescriptiveStudies)), for answering Descriptive RQs;
* Observational studies (Sect. \@ref(ObservationalStudies)), for answering Relational RQs; or 
* Experimental studies (Sect. \@ref(ExperimentalStudies)), for answering Interventional RQs.

The type of study depends on the type of RQ.

::: {.example name="Research design"}
Suppose we wish to compare the effects of echinacea on
the symptoms of the common cold
(based on @data:barrett:echinacea).

*How* could we design such a study to collect the necessary data?

What decisions would you need to make?

## Descriptive studies {#DescriptiveStudies}

Descriptive studies
*are used to answer descriptive RQs*
(Fig. \@ref(fig:POCIDescriptive)).


::: {.definition #DescriptiveStudy name="Descriptive study"}
In a *descriptive study*,\index{descriptive study}
researchers
only focus on collecting, measuring, assessing or describing 
an outcome in the population.

::: {.example #ResearchDesignWeightLoss name="Descriptive study"}

Consider this RQ:

> For overweight men over 60,
> what is the average increase in heart rate after walking 400 metres?

The *outcome* is the average *increase* in heart rate.
The *response variable* is the *increase* in heart rate 
for the individual men.

The increase in heart rate would need to be found 
by measuring each man's heart rate *before* the walk,
then their heart rate *after* the walk,
and finding the difference between them.
The *increase* in heart rate would be computed as the 
*after* heart rate minus the *before* heart rate.

Some of these differences might be positive numbers
(heart rate went *up*),
and some may be negative numbers 
(heart rate went 
*down*).

No *comparison* being made:
every man in the study is treated in the same way.
This is a *descriptive* RQ,
which can be answered by a *descriptive* study.

## Observational studies {#ObservationalStudies}

*Observational studies* (Fig. \@ref(fig:POCIObservational)) are used to answer *relational RQs*.
They are a commonly-used study design, and sometimes are the only possible study design that can be used.


::: {.definition #ObservationalStudy name="Observational study"}

the individuals make this decision themselves).
For this RQ,
the *conditions*
would be taking echinacea,
or not taking echinacea

These differ in when the  response and explanatory variables are observed.
Many specific types of observational studies exist
(case-control studies; cohort studies; etc.),
but we will not delve into these.






   
### Retrospective studies {#RetrospectiveStudies}

In *retrospective studies*,
the response variable is observed *now*,
and the researchers look *back* to see the value of the explanatory variable in the past
(e.g., case-control studies).


::: {.example name="Retrospective studies"}
An Australian study [@data:Pamphlett:toxins] 
examined patients with and without sporadic motor neurone disease (SMND),
and asked about *past* exposure to metals.

The response variable (whether or not the respondent had SMND)
is assessed now,
and whether or not they had exposure to metals (explanatory variable)
is assessed from the *past*.
This is a *retrospective* observational study.
:::




### Prospective studies {#ProspectiveStudies}

In *prospective studies*,
the explanatory variable is determined *now*, 
and researchers look *ahead* to assess or measure the response variable
(e.g., prospective cohort studies).

::: {.example name="Prospective studies"}
A study [@data:Choi2008:GoutSoftdrinks] 
measured the softdrink consumption of men,
and determined who experienced gout over the following 12 years.

The response (whether or not the individuals experience gout)
is determined in the future.
The explanatory variable 
(the amount of softdrink consumed)
is measured now.
This is a *prospective* observational study.
:::






### Cross-sectional studies {#CrosssectionalStudies}

In *cross-sectional studies*,
both the response and explanatory variables are gathered *now*.


::: {.example name="Cross-sectional studies"}
A study [@data:Russell2014:FoodInsecurity] 
asked older Australian their opinions
of their own food security,
and recorded their living arrangements.

Individuals' responses to both
both the response variable and
explanatory variable are gathered *now*.
This is a *cross-sectional* observational study.

In South Australia in 1988--1989, 25 cases of legionella infections (an unusually high number) were investigated [@data:oconnor:pottingmix].
All 25 cases were gardeners, with hanging baskets of ferns.

Researchers compared 25 cases with legionella infections with 75 non-cases, matching on the basis of age (within 5 years), sex, post codes.
The use of potting mix in the previous four weeks was associated with an increase in the risk of contracting illness of about 4.7 times.

What *type* of observational study is this?

`r webexercises::hide()`
*Retrospective*: people were identified with an infection, and then the researchers looked *back* at past activities.
`r webexercises::unhide()`
:::













## Experimental studies {#ExperimentalStudies}

*Experimental studies* (Fig. \@ref(fig:POCIExperiment)),
or *experiments*, are commonly-used study designs.
Well-designed experimental studies can establish a *cause-and-effect relationship* between the response and explantory variables.
However, using experimental studies is not always possible.

Experimental studies have an [*intervention*](https://bookdown.org/pkaldunn/SRM-Textbook/RQs.html#Intervention),
and so *experimental studies are used to answer interventional RQs*.
The researchers *impose* and can *manipulate* the values of the explanatory variable:
they *create* changes in the explanatory variable, and *record* the changes in the response variable.


::: {.definition #Experiment name="Experiment"}
An *experimental study* (or an *experiment*),\index{experimental study}\index{experiment}

### True experimental studies {#TrueExperiments}

*True experiments* are commonly used, 
but conducting a true experiment is not always possible.
An example of a true experiment is a 
*randomised controlled trial*,
often used in drug trials.


::: {.definition #TrueExperiment name="True experiment"}
In a *true experiment*,\index{true experiment}
the researchers:

1. allocate treatments to groups of individuals 
   (i.e., allocate the values of the explanatory for the individuals), *and*
2. determine who or what individuals are in those groups.

While these may not actually happen *explicitly*, they can happen *conceptually*.

A researcher wants to examine the effect of an 
alcohol awareness program [@macdonald2008enough]
on the amount of alcohol consumed in O-Week.
She runs the program at UQ only,
then compared the average amount of drinking per person at two universities (A and B).
What type of study is this: *observational* or *true experimental*?
Answer these questions to help:

1. Does the researcher allocate treatments to the groups? 
2. Does the researcher allocate subjects to groups?

`r webexercises::hide()`
It is *neither*. 

The researcher did not determine the groups: the students (not the researcher) would have chosen University A or University B for many reasons. 
The researcher *did* decide how to allocate the program to University A or University B.

### Quasi-experimental studies {#QuasiExperiments}

Quasi-experiments are similar to true experiments, 
but treatments are *allocated* to groups that already exist.

## Comparing study designs

In *experimental* studies,
researchers *create* differences in the explanatory variable through allocation,
and note the effect this has on the response variable.
In *observational* studies,
researchers *observe* differences in the explanatory variable,
and observe the values in the response variable.
Different RQs require different study designs 
(Table \@ref(tab:StudyTypes)).

Importantly,
*only well-designed true experiments can show cause-and-effect*.
In general,
well-designed true experiments provide stronger evidence than quasi-experiments,
which produce stronger evidence than observational studies.


::: {.example #Autism name="Cause and effect"}
Many studies have reported that the bacteria living in the gut of people on the autism spectrum is different than the bacteria in the gut of people *not* on the autism spectrum (@kang2019long, @ho2020gut).

However, these studies have been observational, so the [suggestion of a cause-and-effect relationship may be inaccurate](https://theconversation.com/gut-bacteria-dont-cause-autism-autistic-kids-microbiome-differences-are-due-to-picky-eating-170366).

Other studies [@yap2021autism] propose that the relationship works the other way:
people on the autism spectrum are more likely to be "picky eaters", which contributes to the differences in their gut bacteria.
:::

Although only experimental studies can show cause-and-effect,
experimental studies are often not possible
for ethical, financial, practical or logistical reasons.
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
   'The animation below compares observational, quasi-experimental and true experimental designs.'
}`
In addition, experimental studies may suffer from lack of [ecological validity](#InterpretApplicability) and the influence of the [Hawthorne effect](#HawthorneEffectExperimental), which some observational studies may manage better.

Well-designed quasi-experiments and observational studies
can still produce strong conclusions,
but cannot be used by themselves to establish cause-and-effect conclusions.

## External and internal validity {#InternalExternalValidity}

As far as possible, all studies should be designed to be 
**externally valid** 
(Chap. \@ref(Sampling))
and
**internally valid**
(Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) and \@ref(DesignObservational))


*Internally validity* refers to how reasonable and logical it is to conclude that changes in the value of the response variable can be attributed to changes in the value of the explanatory variable;
that is,
it refers to the strength of the *inferences* made from the study.

Studies with *high* internal validity show that
changes in the response variable can confidently be 
related to 
changes in the explanatory variable *in the group that was studied*;
the possibility of other explanations has been minimised.

In contrast, studies with *low* internal validity leave open other possibilities, apart from the explanatory variable, to explain changes in the value of the response variable.

**Internally validity** refers to how reasonable and logical it is to conclude that changes in the value of the response variable can be attributed to changes in the values of the explanatory variable;
that is,
the strength of the *inferences* made from the study.

A study with *high* internal validity shows that the changes in the response variable can be attributed to changes in the explanatory variables; other explanations have been ruled out.
:::




::: {.example #LowInternal name="Low internal validity"}
A study of programs that used double-fortified salt programs to manage iodine and iron deficiencies
examined numerous existing studies.
The authors found that 

> Internal validity of the efficacy trials was generally weak, with only 6 out of 22 studies rated as moderate or high quality.
> Primarily, RCTs [i.e., randomised controlled trials] included in this review had **low internal validity** because of issues around selection bias, unaccounted confounders, and participant withdrawals.
>
> --- @larson2021can, p. 26S (emphasis added)
:::


One of many threats to internal validity might be that the
groups being compared are different to begin with
(for example,
if the group receiving echinacea is younger (on average)
than the group receiving no medication).
This is a form of [*confounding*](#def:Confounding).

To check this,
the
*baseline characteristics* of the individuals in the groups can be compared:
the groups being compared should be as similar as possible,
so that any differences in the outcome cannot be attributed to
pre-existing difference in the two groups being compared.


::: {.example name="Baseline characteristics"}
In a study of treating depression in adults
[@data:Danielsson2014:Depression],
three treatments were compared:
exercise, basic body awareness therapy, or advice.

If any differences between the treatments were found,
the researchers need to be confident that the differences 
were due to the treatment.

For this reason,
the three groups were compared to ensure the groups
were similar in terms of
average ages, 
percentage of women,
taking of anti-depressants,
and many other aspects.
:::


An *internally valid* study requires studies to be carefully designed;
this is discussed at length later
(Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) and \@ref(DesignObservational)).
In general,
well-designed experimental studies 
are more likely to be internally valid than observational studies
(Fig. \@ref(fig:StudiesValidity)).

```




A study is *externally valid* if the results of the study
are likely to generalised to *other* groups 
in the *population*, 
apart from those studied in the sample.

For a study to be *externally* valid it first needs to be *internally* valid,
since the results must at least be internally valid for the group under study
before being extended to other members of the population.

Using a *random sample* helps ensure external validity.
In addition,
the use of [*inclusion*](#def:InclusionCriteria) 
and [*exclusion criteria*](#def:ExclusionCriteria) 
(Sect. \@ref(Population))
helps clarify to whom or what the results may apply 
outside of the sample being studied.

::: {.definition #ExternalValidity name="External validity"}
**Externally validity** refers to the ability to
generalise the results to other groups in the *population*,
apart from the sample studied.

For a study to be truly externally valid,
the sample must be a random sample from the population.
:::


A study is *externally valid* if the results from the sample studied
are likely to apply to the intended population.
It does not mean that the results apply more widely than the intended population.

::: {.example #ExternalValidPop name="External validity"}
Suppose the *population* in a study is *Queensland university students*.
The sample would be the students studied.
The study is externally valid if the sample is a random sample from the population of Queensland university students.

The results will not necessarily apply to all Queensland residents,
or university students outside of Queensland.
However, this **has nothing to do with externally validity**.
External validity concerns how the *sample* represents the intended population in the RQ,
which is *Queensland university students*.
The study is not concerned with all Queensland residents,
or with non-Queensland university students.
:::





## The importance of design {#DesignImportance}

Choosing the *type* of study is only a small part of research design.
Planning the data collection process,
and actually collecting the data,
is still required.
Data may be obtained by:

* Using data already available: This is called *secondary data*.
* Collecting new data: This is called *primary data*.
   
Either way,
knowing *how* the data are obtained is important.
The design phase 
is concerned with planning the best way to obtaining the data 
to ensure the study is *internally* and *externally* valid,
as far as possible.


*Internal validity* 
considerations include:

* *What else* might influence the values of the response variable,
  apart from the explanatory variable? (Chap. \@ref(FactorsInfluenceY))
* How can the study be designed *effectively* to maximise internal validity?
  (Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) and \@ref(DesignObservational))
* How exactly will the data be *collected*? (Chap. \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures))

*External* validity considerations include:

* Sampling: Since we can't study the whole population, 
  *who* or *what* do we study in the population (Chap. \@ref(Sampling))?
  And *how many* do we need to study?
  (We need to learn more before we can answer this critical question in Chap. \@ref(Sampling).)


*Ethical* issues must also be considered (Chap. \@ref(Ethics)),
and the limitations of the study understood 
when the results are interpreted (Chap. \@ref(Interpretation)).

## Summary {#Chap3-Summary}

Studies may be **observational** or **experimental**.
Observational studies can usually be classified as 
**retrospective**, **prospective**, or **cross-sectional**.
Experimental studies can usually be classified as
**true experiments** or **quasi-experiments**.
Cause-and-effect conclusions can only be made from
well-designed true experiments.
Ideally studies should be designed to be
**internally** and **externally** valid.

`r if( !knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
' 	 * An observational sudy\\
 	 * A quasi-experimental study\\
 	 * An experimental study'
}`
             
1. A study of a sample whose results apply to the wider population of interest would be called:  
`r if(knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub")){
	longmcq( c("internally valid",
              answer = "externally valid") ) }`
`r if( !knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
' 	 * Internally valud\\
 	 * Externally valid'
}`

1. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers allocate treatments to groups that they have not organised. 
True or false?  
`r if(knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub"))	torf(answer=TRUE)`

1. What is the difference between an true experiment and a quasi-experiment?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
   longmcq( c(
      "In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers do not apply treatments to groups", 
      answer = "In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have determined. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have not determined",
      "In a true experiment, the RQ has a comparison; in a quasi-experiment, the RQ has a connection"))}` 

1. A research study compared the use of two different education programs to reduce the percentage of patients experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).  
Paramedics from two cities were chosen to participate. Paramedics in City A were chosen (at random) to receive Program 1, and paramedics in the other city to receive Program 2.  
What type of study is this?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
   longmcq( c(
      "Observational", 
      answer = "Quasi-experiment",
      "True experiment",
      "Descriptive"))}` 

1. Which of the following are true?

   * True experiments have a higher internal validity than observational studies.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( answer = TRUE)}`
   * Internal validity refers to the strength of the inferences made from the study.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( answer = TRUE)}`
   * Externally validity refers to the ability to generalise the results to other groups apart from those studied.

## Exercises {#ResearchDesignsExercises}

Selected answers are available in Sect. \@ref(ResearchDesignAnswer).


::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignConcreteBeams}

In a  study on the shear strength of recycled concrete beams [@gonzalez2007shear], beams were divided into three groups.
Different loads were then applied to each group, and the shear strength needed to fracture the beams was measured.
 
Is this a *quasi-experiment* or a *true experiment*? 
Answering these questions may help: 

1. Do researchers allocate treatments to the groups? 
2. Do researchers allocate the who or what to groups? 

:::



::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignMatresses}

A study had this aim:

> To compare the effectiveness of alternating pressure air mattresses vs. overlays, to prevent pressure ulcers.
>
> --- @data:Manzano2013:Matresses , p. 2099.

Patients were *provided* with either alternating pressure air overlays (in 2001) or alternating pressure air mattresses (in 2006).
The number of pressure ulcers were recorded.

This study experimental, because the researchers *provided* the mattresses.
Is this a *true* experiment or *quasi*-experiment?
Explain.
:::



::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignPetsAndHealth}

Consider this initial RQ (based on @friedmann1985health), that clearly requires a lot of refining:

> Are people with pets healthier?

To answer this RQ:

1. Describe a useful and practical definition for P, O and C. 
2. Describe an *experimental* study to answer the RQ.
3. Describe an *observational* study to answer the RQ.

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignDietsForWeightLoss}
Consider this journal extract:

> We randomly assigned 811 overweight adults to one of four diets [...]
> The diets consisted of similar foods and met guidelines for cardiovascular health [...]
> The primary outcome was the change in body weight after 2 years in [...] comparisons of low fat versus high fat and average protein versus high protein and in the comparison of highest and lowest carbohydrate content.
