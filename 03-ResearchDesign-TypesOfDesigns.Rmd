## Introduction

Chapter\ \@ref(RQs) introduced four types of research questions: descriptive, relational, repeated-measures and correlational.
This chapter discusses the types of research studies needed to answer these RQs, while Chaps.\ \@ref(Ethics) to\ \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures) discuss the details of designing these studies and collecting the data.


## Three types of study designs {#Three-Research-Designs}

The RQ implies what data *must* be collected from the individuals in the study (the response and explanatory variables)...
but the data can be collected in many different ways.
Different types of studies are used to answer different types of RQs:

* *descriptive* studies (Sect.\ \@ref(DescriptiveStudies)) answer descriptive RQs;
* *observational* studies (Sect.\ \@ref(ObservationalStudies)) answer RQs with an explanatory variable but *no intervention*; and 
* *experimental* studies (Sect.\ \@ref(ExperimentalStudies)) answer RQs with an explanatory variable, that *have an intervention*.

Observational and experimental studies are sometimes collectively called *analytical studies*.\index{Study types!analytical}

## Descriptive studies {#DescriptiveStudies}
\index{Research question!descriptive}\index{Study types!descriptive}\index{Study types!descriptive}

*Descriptive studies* answer descriptive RQs.


::: {.definition #DescriptiveStudy name="Descriptive study"}
*Descriptive studies* answer descriptive research questions.
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-kaboompics-com-6346.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example #DescriptiveStudy name="Descriptive study"}
A study in Hong Kong determined the percentage of people wearing face-masks under different circumstances [@lee2020practice].
This is a descriptive study, where the population is 'residents of Hong Kong', and the outcome is (for example) 'the percentage who wear face masks when taking care of family members with fever'.
:::


We do not explicitly discuss descriptive studies further, as the necessary ideas are present in the discussion of observational and experimental studies.


## Observational studies {#ObservationalStudies}
\index{Research question!relational}\index{Research question!repeated measures}\index{Research question!correlational}\index{Study types!observational}

*Observational studies* are used for RQs with an explanatory variable but no intervention.
They are commonly-used, and sometimes are the only study design possible.


::: {.definition #ObservationalStudy name="Observational study"}
*Observational studies* study relationships *without* an intervention.
:::

<!--          addY = TRUE, -->
<!--          addX = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->


::: {.definition #Conditions name="Condition"}
\index{Conditions}
The *conditions* are the values of the explanatory variable that those in the observational study experience, but are not imposed by the researchers.
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3807629.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example #ObservationalRelationalEchinacea name="Observational study"}
Consider again this one-tailed, decision-making RQ (from Sect.\ \@ref(PopToIndividuals)):

> Among Australian teenagers with a common cold, is the average duration of cold symptoms *shorter* for teens taking a daily dose of echinacea compared to teens taking no medication?

This RQ has a between-individuals comparison, so is a relational RQ.
If the researchers *do not* impose the taking of echinacea (that is, the individuals make this decision themselves), the study is observational.
The two *conditions* are 'taking echinacea', and 'not taking echinacea' (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImageBetween)).
:::


```{r ObsStudiesImageBetween, fig.cap="Observational studies with a relational RQ. The dashed lines indicate steps not under the control of the researchers.", fig.align="center", fig.show="hold", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='65%', cache=FALSE}

                              "No echinacea")) 
```




::: {.example #ResearchDesignWeightLoss name="Within-individuals relational study"}
@levitsky2004freshman recorded the weights of university students at the beginning university, and then after $12$ weeks from the same students.
The comparison is *within* individuals, and the study is a *repeated measures* (paired) study.
Since the researchers do not impose anything on the students; there is *no intervention* (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImageWithin)).
The *outcome* is the average weight.
The *response variable* is the weight of individuals.
The *within-individuals comparison* is the number of weeks after university started ($0$ and $12$).
:::





```{r ObsStudiesImageWithin, fig.cap="Observational studies with a repeated-measures RQ. The dashed lines indicate steps not under the control of the researchers.", fig.align="center", fig.show="hold", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='65%', cache=FALSE}

                                        "After 12 weeks"))

```


::: {.example #ResearchDesignKneeFluid name="Correlational study"}
@poovaragavan2023estimation explored the relationship between time since death, and the concentration of sodium in synovial (knee) fluid.
This is a correlational RQ as groups are not being compared, where the time since death is the explanatory variable, and the concentration of sodium in synovial fluid is the response variable.
The researchers do not impose the time since death, so there is *no intervention* (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImageCorrelational)).
:::


```{r ObsStudiesImageCorrelational, fig.cap="Observational studies with a correlational RQ. The dashed lines indicate steps not under the control of the researchers.", fig.align="center", fig.show="hold", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='65%', cache=FALSE}

                         responseName = "Synovial sodium")
```




## Experimental studies {#ExperimentalStudies}
\index{Research question!relational}\index{Research question!repeated measures}\index{Research question!correlational}\index{Study types!experimental}

*Experimental studies*, or *experiments*, are used for RQs with an explanatory variable and an intervention, and are commonly-used.
Well-designed experimental studies can establish a *cause-and-effect relationship* between the response and explanatory variables.
However, using experimental studies is not always possible.


::: {.definition #Experiment name="Experiment"}
*Experimental studies* (or *experiments*) study relationships *with* an intervention.
:::


::: {.definition #Treatments name="Treatments"}
\index{Treatments}
The *treatments* are the values of the explanatory variable that the researchers impose upon the individuals in the *experimental* study.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
In an *experimental study*, the unit of analysis (Def.\ \@ref(def:UnitOfAnalysis)) is the smallest collection of units of observations that can be randomly allocated to separate treatments.
:::


<!-- ```{r POCIExperiment, fig.cap="An experimental study", fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=2, out.width='65%'} -->

<!--          addX = TRUE,   -->
<!--          addArrows = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->



::: {.example #ResearchDesignWalk400m name="Within-individuals experimental study"}
Consider this estimation RQ:

> For obese men over $60$, what is the average increase in heart rate after walking $400$\ m?

This RQ uses a *within-individuals comparison* (before and after walking $400$\ m) so is a repeated-measures (and paired) RQ.
There is an intervention if researchers impose the $400$\ m walk on the subjects.
The *outcome* is the average heart rate.
The *response variable* is the heart rate for each individual man.

```



*Between*-individuals experimental studies can be either *true experiments* (Sect.\ \@ref(TrueExperiments) or *quasi-experiments* (Sect.\ \@ref(QuasiExperiments)); see Table\ \@ref(tab:ExperimentalStudyDesigns).



### True experimental studies {#TrueExperiments}
\index{Study types!experimental!true}

*True experiments* are commonly used to answer relational RQs.
An example of a true experiment is a *randomised controlled trial*, often used in drug trials.


::: {.definition #TrueExperiment name="True experiment"}
In a *true experiment*, the researchers:

1. allocate treatments to groups of individuals (i.e., allocate the explanatory variable to the individuals), *and*
2. determine who or what individuals are in those groups.

While the steps may not happen *explicit*, they can happen *conceptually*.
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3807629.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>



::: {.example name="True experiment"}
The echinacea study (Sect.\ \@ref(Writing-RQs)) could be designed as a *true experiment*.
The researchers would allocate individuals to one of two groups, and then decide which group took echinacea and which group did not (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TrueExpStudiesImage)).

These steps may happen implicitly: researchers may allocate each person at random to one of the two groups (echinacea; no echinacea).
This is still a true experiment, since the researchers could decide to switch which group receives echinacea; ultimately, the decision is still made by the researchers.
:::


```{r TrueExpStudiesImage, fig.cap="True experimental studies: researchers allocate individuals to groups, and treatments to groups", fig.align="center", fig.show="hold", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='65%'}
showStudyDesign(studyType = "TrueExp", 
                outcomeName = "duration of cold symptoms",
                addIndividuals = TRUE,
                addCNames = c("Echinacea",   
                              "No echinacea"))
```




### Quasi-experimental studies {#QuasiExperiments}
\index{Study types!experimental!quasi}

Quasi-experiments are similar to true experiments (i.e., answer relational RQs)  where treatments are *allocated* to groups that *already exist* (e.g., may be naturally occurring).


::: {.definition #QuasiExperiment name="Quasi-experiment"}
In a *quasi-experiment*, the researchers:
  
1. allocate treatments to groups of individuals (i.e., allocate the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals), but
2. do *not* determine who or what individuals are in those groups.
:::
      

::: {.example #QuasiEchinacea name="Quasi-experiments"}
The echinacea study (Sect.\ \@ref(Writing-RQs)) could be designed as a quasi-experiment.
The researchers could *find* two existing groups of people (say, from Suburbs\ A and\ B), then decide to allocate people in Suburb\ A to take echinacea, and people in Suburb\ B to *not* take echinacea (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:QuasiExpStudiesImage)).
:::


```{r QuasiExpStudiesImage, fig.cap="Quasi-experimental studies: researchers do not allocate individuals to groups, but do allocate treatments to groups. The dashed lines indicate steps not under the control of the researchers.", fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='65%'}
showStudyDesign(studyType = "QuasiExp",
                outcomeName = "duration of cold symptoms",
                addIndividuals = TRUE,  
                addCNames = c("Echinacea",   
                              "No echinacea"))
```


::: {.example #QuasiAlcoholAwareness name="Quasi-experiments"}
A researcher wants to examine the effect of an alcohol awareness program (based on @macdonald2008enough) on the average amount of alcohol consumed per student in a university Orientation Week.
She runs the program at University A only, then compares the average amount of alcohol consumed per person at two universities (A and\ B).

This study is a *quasi-experiment* since the researcher did not (and can not) determine the groups: the students (not the researcher) would have chosen University\ A or University\ B for many reasons.
However, the researcher *did* decide whether to allocate the program to University\ A or University\ B.
:::



## Comparing study types {#CompareStudyTypes}
\index{Study types!compared}

In *experimental* studies, researchers *create* differences in the values of the explanatory variable through allocation, and then note the effect this has on the values of the response variable.
In *observational* studies, researchers *observe* differences in the values of the explanatory variable, and observe the values of the response variable.

Importantly, *only well-designed true experiments can show cause-and-effect*.
Nonetheless, well-designed observational and quasi-experimental studies can provide evidence to *support* cause-and-effect conclusions, especially when supported by other evidence.
Although only true experimental studies can show cause-and-effect, true experimental studies are often not possible for ethical, financial, practical or logistical reasons.

The advantages and disadvantages of each study type are discussed later (Sect.\ \@ref(InterpretStudyDesign)), after these study types are discussed in greater detail in the following chapters.

::: {.example #Autism name="Cause and effect"}
Many studies report that the bacteria in the gut of people on the autism spectrum is different than the bacteria in the gut of people *not* on the autism spectrum (@kang2019long, @ho2020gut), and suggest the bacteria may contribute whether a person is autistic.
These studies were observational, so the\index{Cause and effect}

Other studies [@yap2021autism] suggest that people on the autism spectrum are more likely to be 'picky eaters', which contributes to the differences in gut bacteria.

## Directionality {#Directionality}
\index{Study types!directionality}

Analytical research studies (observational; experimental) can be classified by their *directionality* (Table\ \@ref(tab:TypesOfObsStudies)):

* *Forward direction* (Sect.\ \@ref(Forward)): 
  The values of the explanatory variable are obtained, and the study determines what values of the response variable occur in the future.
  *All experimental studies have a forward direction.*
* *Backward direction* (Sect.\ \@ref(Backward)): 
  The values of the response variable are obtained, then the study determines what values of the explanatory variable occurred in the past.
* *No direction* (Sect.\ \@ref(NonDirectional)): 
  The values of the response and explanatory variables are obtained at the same time.

Directionality is important for understanding cause-and-effect relationships.
If the comparison occurs *before* the outcome is observed, a cause-and-effect relationship *may* be possible.
That is, studies with a forward direction are more likely to provide evidence of causality.

                          "Explanatory variable",
                          "Response variable")

ObsStudies[1, ] <- c("Forward direction",

::: {.example name="Directionality"}
In South Australia in 1988--1989, $25$ cases of legionella infections (an unusually high number) were investigated [@data:oconnor:pottingmix].
All $25$ cases were gardeners.

Researchers compared $25$ people with legionella infections with $75$ similar people without the infection.
The recent use of potting mix was associated with an increase in the risk of contracting illness.

This study has a backward *direction*: people were identified with an infection, and then the researchers looked *back* at past activities.

Research studies are sometimes described as 'prospective'\index{Study types!prospective} or 'retrospective',\index{Study types!prospective} but these terms can be misleading [@ranganathan2018study] and their use not recommended [@VANDENBROUCKE20141500].


*Experimental studies always have a forward direction.*
Observational studies may have any directionality, and may be given different names accordingly.


### Forward-directional studies {#Forward}
\index{Study types!directionality!forward}

All experimental studies have a forward direction, and include *randomised controlled trials* (RCTs) and *clinical trials*.\index{Clinical trials}\index{Randomised controlled trials}

Observational studies with a *forward* direction are often called *cohort studies*.\index{Cohort studies}
Both experimental studies and cohort studies can be expensive and tricky: tracking a group of individuals (a *cohort*) into the future is not always easy, and the ability to track some individuals into the future may be lost (*drop outs*):\index{Drop outs} plants or animals may die; people may move or decide to no longer participate, etc.
Forward-directional observational studies:

* may add support to cause-and-effect conclusions, since the comparison occurs *before* the outcome (only well-designed experimental studies can establish cause-and-effect).
* can examine many different outcomes in one study, since the outcome(s) occur in the future. 
* can be problematic for rare outcomes, as the outcome of interest may not appear (or may appear rarely) in the future.



::: {.example name="Forward study"}
@chih2018incidence studied dogs and cats who had been recommended to receive intermittent nasogastric tube (NGT) aspiration for up to $36$\ hrs.
Some pet owners did not give permission for NGT, while some did; thus, whether the animal received NGT was *not* determined by the researchers (the study is observational).
The researchers then observed whether the animals developed hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (HCMA) in the next $36$\ hrs.

Since the explanatory variable (whether NGT was used or not) was recorded at the start of the study, and the response variable (whether HCMA was observed or not) was determined within the following $36$\ hrs, this study has a *forward direction*.
:::


### Backward-directional studies {#Backward}
\index{Study types!directionality!backward}

Observational studies with a *backward* direction are often called *case-control* studies.\index{Case-control studies}
Researchers find individuals with specific values of the response variable (cases and controls), and determine values of the explanatory variable from the past.
Case-control studies:

* only allow one outcome to be studied, since individuals are chosen to be in the study based on the value of the response variable of interest.
* are useful for rare outcomes: the researchers can purposely select large numbers with the rare outcome of interest.
* do not effectively eliminate other explanations for the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (called *confounding*; Def.\ \@ref(def:Confounding)).
* may suffer from *selection bias* (Sect.\ \@ref(SelectionBias)), as researchers try to locate individuals with a rare outcome.\index{Bias!selection}
* may suffer from *recall bias* (Sect.\ \@ref(Biases)) when the individuals are people: accurately recalling the past can be unreliable.\index{Bias!recall}

::: {.example name="Backwards study"}
@data:Pamphlett:toxins examined patients with and without sporadic motor neurone disease (SMND), and asked about *past* exposure to metals.

The response variable (whether or not the respondent had SMND) is assessed when the study begins, and whether or not subjects had exposure to metals (explanatory variable) is determined from the *past*.
This observational study has a *backward* direction.
:::


### Non-directional studies {#NonDirectional}
\index{Study types!directionality!non-directional}

*Non-directional* observational studies are called *cross-sectional* studies.\index{Cross-sectional studies}
Cross-sectional studies:

* are good for findings associations between variables (which may or may not be causation).
* are generally quicker and cheaper than other types of studies.
* are not useful for studying rare outcomes.
* do not effectively eliminate other explanations for the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (called *confounding*; Def.\ \@ref(def:Confounding)).


::: {.example name="Non-directional study"}
@data:Russell2014:FoodInsecurity asked older Australian their opinions of their own food security, and recorded their living arrangements.
Individuals' responses to both both the response variable and explanatory variable were gathered at the same time.
This observational study is *non-directional*.
:::



## The role of study design {#DesignImportance}

Choosing the *type* of study is only one part of research design; many other decisions must be made also.
The purpose of these research design decisions is ensure researchers can focus on the relationship of interest (*internal validity*) in the population of interest (*external validity*).

Designing a study to maximise *internal validity* means:

* identifying *what else* might influence the values of the response variable, apart from the explanatory variable (Chap.\ \@ref(FactorsInfluenceY)); and
* designing the study to be *effective* (Chaps.\ \@ref(DesignExperiment) and\ \@ref(DesignObservational)).

In general, experimental studies have better internal validity than observational studies.

Designing a study to maximise *external validity* means:

* identifying who or what to study, since the whole population cannot be studied (Chap.\ \@ref(Sampling)); and
* determining *how many* individuals to study.
  (We need to learn more before we can answer this critical question in Chap.\ \@ref(EstimatingSampleSize).)

The details of how the data will be *collected* (Chap.\ \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures)) and *ethical* issues (Chap.\ \@ref(Ethics)) must also be considered.
Furthermore, the limitations of the study must be communicated (Chap.\ \@ref(Interpretation)).

## Chapter summary {#Chap3-Summary}

Three types of research studies are: *Descriptive studies* (for descriptive RQs), *observational studies* (for studying relationships *without* an intervention), and *experimental* (for studying relationships *with* an intervention).

Observational studies can be classified as having a *forward direction* (cohort studies), *backward direction* (case-control studies), or *no direction* (cross-sectional studies).
Experimental studies always have a forward direction.
Relational RQs with an intervention can be classified as *true experiments* or *quasi-experiments*.
Cause-and-effect conclusions can only be made from well-designed *true experiments*.

Ideally studies should be designed to be *internally* and *externally* valid.
In general, experimental studies have better internal validity than observational studies.

## Quick review questions {#Chap3-QuickReview}

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}
1. A study [@fraboni2018red] examined the 'red-light running behaviour of cyclists in Italy'. \tightlist
This study is most likely to be: `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()){
'  (a) an observational study; (b) a quasi-experimental study; or (c) an experimental study.'
}`
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
	longmcq( c(answer = "an observational study",
             "a quasi-experimental study",
             "an experimental study"))}`
1. What is the difference between a true and a quasi-experiment? \tightlist
 `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()){
'  a. In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers do not apply treatments to groups. 
   b. In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have determined. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have not determined.
   c. In a true experiment, the RQ has a comparison; in a quasi-experiment, the RQ does not have a comparison.'
}`
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
   longmcq( c(
      "In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers do not apply treatments to groups", 
      answer = "In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have determined. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have not determined",
      "In a true experiment, the RQ has a comparison; in a quasi-experiment, the RQ does not have a comparison."))}` 
1. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers allocate treatments to groups that they cannot manipulate. 
   True or false?
`r if(knitr::is_html_output())	torf(answer=TRUE)`
1. True experiments generally have a higher internal validity than observational studies.
   True or false?\tightlist

:::{.exercise #TypesOfDesignsAcuteOtitis}
Consider this RQ [@data:McLinn:otitis]:

> In children with acute otitis media, what is the difference in the average duration of symptoms when treated with cefuroxime compared to amoxicillin?

1. Is the comparison a within- or between-individuals comparison?
1. Is this RQ relational, repeated-measures or correlational?
1. Is there likely an intervention?
1. Is the RQ an estimation or decision-making RQ?
1. Is the study observational or experimental?
   If observational, what is the *direction*?
   If experiment, is this a quasi-experiment or true experiment?

::: {.exercise #TypesOfDesignsWorms}
@data:Khair2015:Earthworms studied the time needed for organic waste to turn into compost.
For some batches of compost, earthworms were added.
In other batches, earthworms were *not* added to the waste.

One RQs asked whether the composting times for waste with and without earthworms was the same or not. 

1. Is the comparison a within- or between-individuals comparison?
1. Is this RQ relational, repeated-measures or correlational?
1. Is there an intervention?

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignConcreteBeams}
@gonzalez2007shear studied recycled concrete beams.
Beams were divided into three groups, different loads were then applied to each group, then the shear strength needed to fracture the beams was measured.
Is this a *quasi-experiment* or a *true experiment*? 
Explain.

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignVAP}
A research study compared the use of two different education programs to reduce the percentage of patients experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Paramedics from two cities were chosen to participate. 
Paramedics in City\ A were chosen to receive Program\ 1, and paramedics in the other city to receive Program\ 2.

1. Is this RQ relational, repeated-measures or correlational?
1. Is the comparison a within- or between-individuals comparison?
1. Is there likely an intervention?
1. Is the study observational or experimental?
   If observational, what is the *direction*?
   If experiment, is this a quasi-experiment or true experiment?
:::



::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignMatresses}
@data:Manzano2013:Matresses compared 'the effectiveness of alternating pressure air mattresses vs. overlays, to prevent pressure ulcers' (p.\ 2099).
Patients were *provided* with alternating pressure air overlays (in 2001) or alternating pressure air mattresses (in 2006).
The number of pressure ulcers were recorded.

This study is experimental, because the researchers *provided* the mattresses.
Is this a *true* experiment or *quasi*-experiment?
Explain.
