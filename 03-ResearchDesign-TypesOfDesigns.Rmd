## Three types of study designs {#Three-Research-Designs}

The RQ implies what data *must* be collected from the individuals in the study (the response and explanatory variables)...
but *how* are the data obtained?
After all, data are important: they are the means by which the RQ is answered.

Different types of studies are used for different types of RQs:

* *Nonanalytical studies*, that do *not* study relationships, are used for:
  * *Descriptive* studies (Sect. \@ref(DescriptiveStudies)) to answer Descriptive RQs;
* *Analytical studies*, for studying relationships, are used for:
  * *Observational* studies (Sect. \@ref(ObservationalStudies)) to answer Relational RQs; or 
  * *Experimental* studies (Sect. \@ref(ExperimentalStudies)) to answer Interventional RQs.

Suppose we wish to compare the effects of echinacea on the symptoms of the common cold (based on @data:barrett:echinacea).
What decisions would need to be made to design a study to collect the data?
:::


## Descriptive studies {#DescriptiveStudies}

*Descriptive studies* answer descriptive RQs (Fig. \@ref(fig:POCIDescriptive)), which only specify a population and outcome.


::: {.definition #DescriptiveStudy name="Descriptive study"}
*Descriptive studies* answer descriptive research questions, and do not study relationships between variables.
:::


```{r POCIDescriptive, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A descriptive study, used to answer a descriptive RQ", fig.align="center",fig.height=2, fig.width=6, out.width='60%'}
showPOCI(addArrows = TRUE, 
         addY = TRUE) 
```




<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-kaboompics-com-6346.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example #ResearchDesignWeightLoss name="Descriptive study"}
Consider this RQ:

> For obese men over 60, what is the average increase in heart rate after walking 400 metres?

The *outcome* is the average *increase* in heart rate.
The *response variable* is the *increase* in heart rate for each individual man, found by measuring each man's heart rate *before* the walk, then their heart rate *after* the walk (measured *within-individuals*).

The *increase* in heart rate for each man would be computed as the *after* heart rate minus the *before* heart rate.
Some differences might be positive numbers (heart rate *increased*), and some may be negative numbers (heart rate *decreased*).

No between-individuals *comparison* is being made: every man in the study is treated in the same way.
This is a *descriptive* RQ, which can be answered by a *descriptive* study.
:::

We do not explicitly discuss descriptive studies further, as they can be considered as a special case of observational studies.


## Observational studies {#ObservationalStudies}

*Observational studies* (Fig. \@ref(fig:POCIObservational)) answer *relational RQs* to study relationships.
They are commonly-used, and sometimes are the study design possible.


::: {.definition #ObservationalStudy name="Observational study"}
*Observational studies* answer relational research questions.
:::


```{r POCIObservational, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="An observational study, used to answer a relational RQ", fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=2, out.width='60%'}
showPOCI(addC = TRUE,
         addI = FALSE,
         addArrows = TRUE,
         addY = TRUE,
         addX = TRUE)
```


::: {.definition #Conditions name="Condition"}
*Conditions*: The conditions are the values of the comparison or connection that those in the observational study experience.
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3807629.jpg" width="200px"/>

::: {.example name="Observational study"}
Consider again this RQ [@data:barrett:echinacea]:

> Among Australian teens with a common cold, is the *average* duration of cold symptoms shorter for teens taking a daily dose of echinacea compared to teens taking no medication?

This would be a relational RQ if the researchers do not impose the taking of echinacea (that is, the individuals make this decision themselves).
For this observational study, the two *conditions* are 'taking echinacea', and 'not taking echinacea' (Fig. \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImage)).
:::


```{r ObsStudiesImage, echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Observational studies", fig.align="center", fig.width=7, fig.height=3, out.width='80%'}

showStudyDesign(studyType = "Obs", 
                addIndividuals = TRUE, 
                addCNames = c("Echinacea",
                              "No echinacea"))

```


## Experimental studies {#ExperimentalStudies}

*Experimental studies* (Fig. \@ref(fig:POCIExperiment)), or *experiments*, are commonly-used to study relationships.
Well-designed experimental studies can establish a *cause-and-effect relationship* between the response and explanatory variables.
However, using experimental studies is not always possible.
Experiments have an [*intervention*](#def:Intervention), and so *experimental studies answer interventional RQs*.


::: {.definition #Experiment name="Experiment"}
*Experimental studies* (or *experiments*) answer interventional research questions.
:::


::: {.definition #Treatments name="Treatments"}
The *treatments* are the values of the comparison or connection that the researchers impose upon the individuals in the *experimental* study.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
In an **experimental study**, the unit of analysis (Def. \@ref(def:UnitOfAnalysis)) is the smallest collection of units of observations that can be randomly allocated to separate treatments.
:::


```{r POCIExperiment, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="An experimental study, used to answer interventional RQs", fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=2, out.width='65%'}
showPOCI(addC = TRUE,
         addI = TRUE,
         addY = TRUE, 
         addX = TRUE, 
         addArrows = TRUE)
```



Two types of experimental studies (Table \@ref(tab:ExperimentalStudyDesigns)) are [*true experiments*](#TrueExperiments) and [*quasi-experiments*](#QuasiExperiments).

### True experimental studies {#TrueExperiments}

*True experiments* are commonly used, but are not always possible.
An example of a true experiment is a *randomised controlled trial*, often used in drug trials.


::: {.definition #TrueExperiment name="True experiment"}
In a *true experiment*, the researchers:

1. allocate treatments to groups of individuals (i.e., determine the values of the explanatory for the individuals), *and*
2. determine who or what individuals are in those groups.

While these may not actually happen in these *explicit* steps, they can happen *conceptually*.
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3807629.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>



::: {.example name="True experiment"}
The echinacea study (Sect. \@ref(Writing-RQs)) could be designed as a *true experiment*.
The researchers would allocate individuals to one of two groups, and then decide which group took echinacea and which group did not (Fig. \@ref(fig:TrueExpStudiesImage)).

These steps may happen implicitly: Researchers may allocate each person at random to one of the two groups (echinacea; no echinacea).
This is still a true experiment, since the researchers may decide to switch which group receives echinacea; ultimately, the decision is still made by the researchers.
:::


```{r TrueExpStudiesImage, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="True experimental studies", fig.align="center", fig.width=7, fig.height=3, out.width='80%'}
showStudyDesign(studyType = "TrueExp",
                addIndividuals = TRUE, 
                addCNames = c("Echinacea", 
                              "No echinacea"))
```


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
A researcher wants to examine the effect of an alcohol awareness program [@macdonald2008enough] on the amount of alcohol consumed in Orientation Week.
She runs the program at University A only, then compares the average amount of drinking per person at two universities (A and B).
Is this study *observational* or *true experimental*?\label{thinkBox:AlcoholProgram}

`r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) '<!--'`
`r webexercises::hide()`
*Neither* observational, or a true experiment. 

The researcher did not determine the groups: the students (not the researcher) would have chosen University A or University B for many reasons. 
The researcher *did* decide how to allocate the program to University A or University B.
`r webexercises::unhide()`
`r if (!knitr::is_html_output()) '-->'`
:::


### Quasi-experimental studies {#QuasiExperiments}

Quasi-experiments are similar to true experiments, but treatments are *allocated* to groups that *already exist* (i.e., may be naturally occuring).

::: {.definition #QuasiExperiment name="Quasi-experiment"}
In a *quasi-experiment*, the researchers:
  
* allocate treatments to groups of individuals (i.e., allocate the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals), but
* do **not** determine who or what individuals are in those groups.
:::
      

::: {.example name="Quasi-experiments"}
The echinacea study (Sect. \@ref(Writing-RQs)) could be designed as a quasi-experiment.
The researchers could *find* (not *create*) two existing groups of people (say, from Suburbs A and B), then decide to allocate people in Suburb A to take echinacea, and people in Suburb B to *not* take echinacea (Fig. \@ref(fig:QuasiExpStudiesImage)).
:::


```{r QuasiExpStudiesImage, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Quasi-experimental studies", fig.align="center", fig.width=7, fig.height=3, out.width='80%'}
showStudyDesign(studyType = "QuasiExp",
                addIndividuals = TRUE, 
                addCNames = c("Echinacea", 
                              "No echinacea"))
```




## Comparing study types {#CompareStudyTypes}

Different RQs require different study designs (Table \@ref(tab:StudyTypes)).
In *experimental* studies, researchers *create* differences in the explanatory variable through allocation, and note the effect this has on the response variable.
In *observational* studies, researchers *observe* differences in the explanatory variable, and observe the values in the response variable.

Importantly, *only well-designed true experiments can show cause-and-effect*.
Nonetheless, well-designed observational and quasi-experimental studies can provide evidence to support cause-and-effect conclusions, especially when supported by other evidence.
Although only experimental studies can show cause-and-effect, experimental studies are often not possible for ethical, financial, practical or logistical reasons.

The advantages and disadvantages of each study type are discussed later (Table \@ref(tab:StudyProsCons)), after other issues are examined in the following chapters.

::: {.example #Autism name="Cause and effect"}
Many studies report that the bacteria living in the gut of people on the autism spectrum is different than the bacteria in the gut of people *not* on the autism spectrum (@kang2019long, @ho2020gut), and suggest the bacteria may contribute whether a person is autistic.
These studies were observational, so the 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'suggestion of a cause-and-effect relationship may be inaccurate.'
} else {
  '[suggestion of a cause-and-effect relationship may be inaccurate](https://theconversation.com/gut-bacteria-dont-cause-autism-autistic-kids-microbiome-differences-are-due-to-picky-eating-170366).'
}`

Other studies [@yap2021autism] suggest that people on the autism spectrum are more likely to be "picky eaters", which contributes to the differences in gut bacteria.

## Directionality {#Directionality}

Analytical research studies (observational; experimental) can be classified by their *directionality* (Table \@ref(tab:TypesOfObsStudies)):

* [*Forward direction*](#ForwardStudies): 
  The values of the explanatory variable are obtained, and the study determines what values of the response variable occur in the future.
  *All experimental studies have a forward direction.*
* [*Backward direction*](#BackwardStudies): 
  The values of the response variable are obtained, then the study determines what values of the explanatory variable occurred in the past.
* [*No direction*](#NondirectionalStudies): 
  The values of the response and explanatory variables are obtained at the same time.

Directionality is important for understanding cause-and-effect relationships.
If the comparison/connection occurs *before* the outcome is observed, a cause-and-effect relationship *may* be possible.
That is, studies with a forward direction are more likely to provide evidence of causality.

::: {.example name="Backwards study"}
A study [@data:Pamphlett:toxins] examined patients with and without sporadic motor neurone disease (SMND), and asked about *past* exposure to metals.

The response variable (whether or not the respondent had SMND) is assessed when the study begins, and whether or not they had exposure to metals (explanatory variable) is determined from the *past*.
This observational study has a *backward* direction.
:::


::: {.example name="Forward study"}
@chih2018incidence studied dogs and cats who had been recommended to receive intermittent nasogastric tube (NGT) aspiration for up to 36 hours.
Some pet owners did not give permission for NGT, while some did give permission; thus, whether the animal received NGT was *not* determined by the researchers (hence this is an observational study).
The researchers then observed whether the animals developed hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (HCMA) in the next 36 hours.

Since the explanatory variable (whether NGT was used or not) was recorded at the start of the study, and the response variable (whether HCMA was observed or not) was determined within the following 36 hours, this study has a *forward direction*.

::: {.example name="Non-directional study"}
A study [@data:Russell2014:FoodInsecurity] asked older Australian their opinions of their own food security, and recorded their living arrangements.
Individuals' responses to both both the response variable and explanatory variable were gathered when the study began.
This observational study is *non-directional*.

In South Australia in 1988--1989, 25 cases of legionella infections (an unusually high number) were investigated [@data:oconnor:pottingmix].
All 25 cases were gardeners.\label{thinkBox:GardenersDirection}
\smallskip

Researchers compared 25 people with legionella infections with 75 people without the infection, matching on the basis of age (within 5 years), sex, and post codes.
The use of potting mix in the previous four weeks was associated with an increase in the risk of contracting illness of about 4.7 times.

Research studies are often described as 'prospective' or 'retrospective', but these terms can be misleading [@ranganathan2018study] and their use is no longer recommended [@VANDENBROUCKE20141500].


*Experimental studies always have a forward direction.*
Observational studies may have any directionality, and are sometimes given different names accordingly.


### Forward-directional studies {#Forward}

All experimental studies have a forward direction, and include *randomised controlled trials* (RCTs) and *clinical trials*.

Observational studies with a *forward* direction are often called *cohort studies*.
Researchers find individuals with existing values of the explanatory variable, and observe what values of the response variable appear in the future.

Both experimental studies and cohort studies can be expensive and tricky: tracking individuals into the future is not always easy, and individuals may be lost to follow-up (*drop-outs*).
Forward-directional observational studies:

* may add support to cause-and-effect conclusions, since the comparison/connection occurs *before* the outcome (only well-designed experimental studies can establish cause-and-effect).
* can examine many different outcomes in one study, since the outcome(s) occur in the future. 
* can be problematic for rare outcomes, as the outcome of interest may not appear (or may appear rarely) in the future.


### Backward-directional studies {#Backward}

Two types of observational studies with a *backward* direction are often called *case-control* studies.
Researchers find individuals with specific values of the response variable (the cases and the controls), and determine values of the explanatory variable from the past.
Case-control studies:

* only allow one outcome to be studied, since individuals are chosen to be in the study based on the value of the response variable of interest.
* are useful for rare outcomes: The researchers can purposely select large numbers with the rare outcome of interest.
* do not effectively eliminate other explanations for the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (called *confounding*; Def. \@ref(def:Confounding)).
* may suffer from *sampling bias*, as researchers try to locate individuals with a rare outcome.
* may suffer from *recall bias* when the individuals are people: accurately recalling the past can be unreliable.


### Non-directional studies {#NonDirectional}

*Non-directional* observational studies are called *cross-sectional* studies.
Cross-sectional studies are:

* good for findings associations between variables (which may or may not be causation).
* generally quicker and cheaper than other types of studies.
* not useful for studying rare outcomes.
* do not effectively eliminate other explanations for the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (called *confounding*; Def. \@ref(def:Confounding)).


## Internal validity {#IntroInternalValidity}

Ideally, all studies should be designed to be *internally valid* (Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) and \@ref(DesignObservational)).

*Internally validity* refers to how reasonable and logical it is to conclude that changes in the value of the response variable can be attributed to changes in the value of the explanatory variable; that is, it refers to the strength of the *inferences* made from those studied.

Studies with *high* internal validity show that changes in the response variable can confidently be related to changes in the explanatory variable *in the group that was studied*; the possibility of other explanations has been minimised.

In contrast, studies with *low* internal validity leave open other possibilities, apart from changes in value of the explanatory variable, to explain changes in the value of the response variable.
Experimental studies usually have higher internal validity than observational studies.

</div>


::: {.definition #InternalValidity name="Internal validity"}
**Internally validity** refers to how reasonable and logical it is to conclude that changes in the value of the response variable can be attributed to changes in the values of the explanatory variable; that is, the strength of the *inferences* made from those studied.

A study with *high* internal validity shows that the changes in the response variable can be attributed to changes in the explanatory variables; other explanations have been ruled out.
:::


::: {.example #LowInternal name="Low internal validity"}
The authors of a review of existing studies that used double-fortified salt to manage iodine and iron deficiencies concluded:

> Internal validity of the efficacy trials was generally weak [...] because of issues around selection bias, unaccounted confounders, and participant withdrawals.
>
> --- @larson2021can, p. 26S
:::


One of many potential threats to internal validity is that the groups being compared are initially different; for example, if the group receiving echinacea is younger (on average) than the group receiving no medication.
This is a form of *confounding* (Def. \@ref(def:Confounding)).

To check this, the *baseline characteristics* of the individuals in the groups can be compared: the groups being compared should be as similar as possible, so that any differences in the outcome cannot be attributed to pre-existing difference in the groups.


::: {.example name="Baseline characteristics"}
In a study of treating depression in adults [@data:Danielsson2014:Depression], three treatments were compared: exercise, basic body awareness therapy, or advice.

If any differences among the treatments were found, the researchers need to be confident that the differences were due to the treatment.
For this reason, the three groups were compared to ensure the groups were similar in terms of average ages, percentage of women, taking of anti-depressants, and many other aspects.
:::


An *internally valid* study requires studies to be carefully designed; this is discussed at length later (Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) and \@ref(DesignObservational)).
In general, well-designed experimental studies are more likely to be internally valid than observational studies.


## External validity {#IntroExternalValidity}

A study is *externally valid* if the results of the study are likely to generalise to the rest of the *population*, beyond just those studied in the sample.
For a study to be *externally* valid, it first needs to be *internally* valid, since the results must at least be sound for the group under study before being extended to other members of the population.

Using a *random sample* helps ensure external validity.
In addition, the use of [*inclusion*](#def:InclusionCriteria) and [*exclusion criteria*](#def:ExclusionCriteria) (Sect. \@ref(Population)) helps clarify to whom or what the results may apply outside of the sample being studied.


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-share-11-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #ExternalValidity name="External validity"}
**Externally validity** refers to the ability to generalise the results to the rest of the population, beyond just those in the sample studied.
For a study to be truly externally valid, the sample must be a random sample (Chap. \@ref(Sampling)) from the population.
:::


*Externally validity* does *not* mean that the results apply more widely than the intended population.


::: {.example #ExternalValidPop name="External validity"}
Suppose the *population* in a study is *Californian university students*.
The sample comprises the Californian university students actually studied.
The study is externally valid if the sample is a random sample from the population of all Californian university students.

The results will not necessarily apply to university students outside of Californian (though they may), or all Californian residents.
However, this *is irrelevant for externally validity*.
External validity concerns how the *sample* represents the intended population in the RQ, which is *Californian university students*.
The study is not concerned with all Californian residents, or with non-Californian university students.
:::


## The importance of design {#DesignImportance}

Choosing the *type* of study is only one part of research design.
Planning the data collection process, and actually collecting the data, is still required.
Sometimes, data may be already available (called *secondary data*), or may need collecting (called *primary data*).

Either way, knowing *how* the data are obtained is important.
The design phase is concerned with planning the best approach to obtaining the data, to ensure the study is *internally* and *externally* valid, as far as possible.

*Internal validity* considerations include:

* *What else* might influence the values of the response variable, apart from the explanatory variable? (Chap. \@ref(FactorsInfluenceY))
* How can the study be designed *effectively* to maximise internal validity? (Chaps. \@ref(DesignExperiment) and \@ref(DesignObservational))

*External* validity considerations include:

* Sampling: Since the whole population cannot be studied, *who* or *what* do we study in the population (Chap. \@ref(Sampling))?
  And *how many* do we need to study?
  (We need to learn more before we can answer this critical question in Chap. \@ref(EstimatingSampleSize).)

The details of how the data will be *collected* (Chap. \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures)) and *ethical* issues (Chap. \@ref(Ethics)) must also be considered.
Furthermore, the limitations of the study must be communicated (Chap. \@ref(Interpretation)).

## Summary {#Chap3-Summary}

Three types of research studies are: *Descriptive studies* (for descriptive RQs), *observational studies* (for relational RQs), and *experimental* (for interventional RQs).

Observational studies can usually be classified as having a *forward direction* (cohort studies), *backward direction* (case-control studies), or *no direction* (cross sectional studies).
Experimental studies always have a forward direction, and can be classified as *true experiments* or *quasi-experiments*.
Cause-and-effect conclusions can only be made from well-designed *true experiments*.

Ideally studies should be designed to be *internally* and *externally* valid.
In general, experimental studies have better internal validity than observational studies.

## Quick review questions {#Chap3-QuickReview}

1. A study [@fraboni2018red] examined the 'red-light running behaviour of cyclists in Italy'.
This study is most likely to be: `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()){
'  (a) An observational study; (b) A quasi-experimental study; or (c) An experimental study.'
}`
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {

             "a quasi-experimental study",
             "an experimental study"))}`
             
1. A study of a sample whose results apply to the wider population of interest would be called:  `r if( !knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {' (a) Internally valid; or (b) Externally valid.'}`

	longmcq( c("internally valid",
              answer = "externally valid") ) }`

1. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers allocate treatments to groups that they have not organised. 
True or false?
`r if(knitr::is_html_output())	torf(answer=TRUE)`

1. What is the difference between an true experiment and a quasi-experiment?
 `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()){
'  a. In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers do not apply treatments to groups; b. In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have determined. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have not determined; or c. In a true experiment, the RQ has a comparison; in a quasi-experiment, the RQ has a connection.'
}`
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
   longmcq( c(
      "In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers do not apply treatments to groups", 
      answer = "In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have determined. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have not determined",
      "In a true experiment, the RQ has a comparison; in a quasi-experiment, the RQ has a connection"))}` 

1. A research study compared the use of two different education programs to reduce the percentage of patients experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Paramedics from two cities were chosen to participate. Paramedics in City A were chosen to receive Program 1, and paramedics in the other city to receive Program 2.
What type of study is this?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
   longmcq( c(
      "Observational", 
      answer = "Quasi-experiment",
      "True experiment",
      "Descriptive"))}` 

1. Which of the following are true?

   a. True experiments have a higher internal validity than observational studies.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( answer = TRUE)}`
   b. Internal validity refers to the strength of the inferences made from the study.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( answer = TRUE)}`
   c. Externally validity refers to the ability to generalise the results to other groups apart from those studied.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( answer = TRUE)}`
   d. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be used to clarify the internal validity.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( answer = FALSE)}`
   e. Observational studies have a higher external validity than experimental studies.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {torf( answer = FALSE)}`

Selected answers are available in Sect. \@ref(ResearchDesignAnswer).

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignConcreteBeams}

In a  study on the shear strength of recycled concrete beams [@gonzalez2007shear], beams were divided into three groups.
Different loads were then applied to each group, and the shear strength needed to fracture the beams was measured.
Is this a *quasi-experiment* or a *true experiment*? 
Explain.
:::


::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignMatresses}

A nursing study aimed to compare "the effectiveness of alternating pressure air mattresses vs. overlays, to prevent pressure ulcers" (@data:Manzano2013:Matresses , p. 2099).
Patients were *provided* with either alternating pressure air overlays (in 2001) or alternating pressure air mattresses (in 2006).
The number of pressure ulcers were recorded.

This study is experimental, because the researchers *provided* the mattresses.
Is this a *true* experiment or *quasi*-experiment?
Explain.

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignPetsAndHealth}
Consider this initial RQ (based on @friedmann1985health), that clearly requires a lot of refining: "Are people with pets healthier?"
To answer this RQ:

1. Describe useful and practical definitions for P, O and C. 
2. Describe an *experimental* study to answer the RQ.
3. Describe an *observational* study to answer the RQ.

**Answers to in-chapter questions:**

- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:AlcoholProgram}: *Neither* observational, or a true experiment. The researcher did not determine the groups: the students (not the researcher) would have chosen University A or University B for many reasons. 
The researcher *did* decide how to allocate the program to University A or University B.
- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:GardenersDirection}: *Backward directionality*: people were identified with an infection (response), and then the researchers looked *back* at past activities (explanatory).
- \textbf{\textit{Quick Revision} questions:}
**1.** Observational.
**2.** Externally valid.
**3.** True.
**4.** In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have determined. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have not determined.
**5.** Quasi-experiment.
**6.** The first three statements only are true.
