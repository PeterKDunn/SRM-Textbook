## Introduction

Chapter\ \@ref(RQs) introduced four types of research questions: descriptive, relational, repeated-measures and correlational.
This chapter discusses the types of research studies needed to answer descriptive, relational and repeated-measures RQs, while Chaps.\ \@ref(Ethics) to\ \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures) discuss the details of designing these studies and collecting the data.
Many of the ideas also apply to correlational studies.


## Three types of study designs {#Three-Research-Designs}

The RQ implies what data *must* be collected from the individuals in the study (the response and explanatory variables)...
but the data can be collected in many different ways.
Different types of studies are used to answer different types of RQs:

* *descriptive* studies (Sect.\ \@ref(DescriptiveStudies)) answer descriptive RQs;
* *observational* studies (Sect.\ \@ref(ObservationalStudies)) answer RQs with a comparison, that *do not have* an intervention; and 
* *experimental* studies (Sect.\ \@ref(ExperimentalStudies)) answer RQs with a comparison, that *do have* an intervention.

Observational and experimental studies are sometimes collectively called *analytical studies*.\index{Study types!analytical}

## Descriptive studies {#DescriptiveStudies}
\index{Research question!descriptive}\index{Study types!descriptive}

*Descriptive studies* answer descriptive RQs (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:POCIDescriptive)).


::: {.definition #DescriptiveStudy name="Descriptive study"}
*Descriptive studies* answer descriptive research questions, and do not study relationships between variables.

::: {.example #DescriptiveStudy name="Descriptive study"}
A study in Hong Kong determined the percentage of people wearing face-masks under different circumstances [@lee2020practice].
This is a descriptive study, where the population is 'residents of Hong Kong', and the outcome is (for example) 'the percentage who wear face masks when taking care of family members with fever'.
:::


We do not explicitly discuss descriptive studies further, as the necessary ideas are present in the discussion of observational and experimental studies.


## Observational studies {#ObservationalStudies}
\index{Research question!relational}\index{Research question!repeated measures}\index{Research question!correlational}\index{Study types!observational}

*Observational studies* (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:POCIObservational)) answer *relational and repeated-measures RQs* without an intervention.
They are commonly-used, and sometimes are the only study design possible.


::: {.definition #ObservationalStudy name="Observational study"}
*Observational studies* answer research questions with a comparison, but *without* an intervention.
:::


```{r POCIObservational, fig.cap="An observational study", fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=2, out.width='60%'}

         addI = FALSE,
         addArrows = TRUE,  
         addY = TRUE,
         addX = TRUE)
```


::: {.definition #Conditions name="Condition"}
\index{Conditions}
*Conditions*: The *conditions* are the values of the comparison that those in the observational study experience, but are not imposed by the researchers.

::: {.example #ObservationalRelationalEchinacea name="Observational study"}
Consider again this one-tailed, decision-making RQ (see Sect.\ \@ref(PopToIndividuals)):

> Among Australian teens with a common cold, is the average duration of cold symptoms *shorter* for teens taking a daily dose of echinacea compared to teens taking no medication?

This RQ has a between-individuals comparison, so is a relational RQ.
If the researchers *do not* impose the taking of echinacea (that is, the individuals make this decision themselves), the study is observational.
The two *conditions* are 'taking echinacea', and 'not taking echinacea' (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImageBetween)).

```




::: {.example #ResearchDesignWeightLoss name="Within-individuals relational study"}
@levitsky2004freshman conducted a study where the weights of university students were recorded both at the beginning university, and then after $12$ weeks.
The comparison is *within* individuals, and the study is a *repeated measures* (paired) study.
Since the researchers do not impose anything on the students (they just measure their weight at two time points), there is *no intervention* (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ObsStudiesImageWithin)).
The *outcome* is the average weight.
The *response variable* is the weight of individuals.
The *within-individuals comparison* is the number of weeks after university started ($0$ and $12$).
:::





```{r ObsStudiesImageWithin, fig.cap="Observational studies with a within-individuals comparison", fig.align="center", fig.show="hold", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='65%', cache=FALSE}

## Experimental studies {#ExperimentalStudies}
\index{Research question!relational}\index{Research question!repeated measures}\index{Research question!correlational}\index{Study types!experimental}

*Experimental studies* (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:POCIExperiment)), or *experiments*, are used to study relationships with an *intervention*, and are commonly-used.
Well-designed experimental studies can establish a *cause-and-effect relationship* between the response and explanatory variables.
However, using experimental studies is not always possible.


::: {.definition #Experiment name="Experiment"}
*Experimental studies* (or *experiments*) answer RQs answer research questions with a comparison *with* an intervention.
:::


::: {.definition #Treatments name="Treatments"}
\index{Treatments}
The *treatments* are the values of the comparison that the researchers impose upon the individuals in the *experimental* study.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
In an *experimental study*, the unit of analysis (Def.\ \@ref(def:UnitOfAnalysis)) is the smallest collection of units of observations that can be randomly allocated to separate treatments.
:::


```{r POCIExperiment, fig.cap="An experimental study", fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=2, out.width='65%'}
showPOCI(addC = TRUE,
         addI = TRUE,
         addY = TRUE, 
         addX = TRUE,  
         addArrows = TRUE)
```



::: {.example #ResearchDesignWalk400m name="Within-individuals experimental study"}
Consider this estimation RQ:

> For obese men over $60$, what is the average increase in heart rate after walking $400$\ m?

This RQ uses a *within-individuals comparison* (before and after walking $400$\ m) so is a repeated-measures (and paired) RQ.
There is an intervention if researchers impose the $400$\ m walk on the subjects.
The *outcome* is the average heart rate.
The *response variable* is the heart rate for each individual man.
:::



```{r ExpStudiesImageWithin, fig.cap="Experimental studies with a within-individuals comparison", fig.align="center", fig.show="hold", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='65%', cache=FALSE}

showRepeatedMStudyDesign(intervention = TRUE,
                         interventionName = "Walk 400 m",

### True experimental studies {#TrueExperiments}
\index{Study types!experimental!true}

*True experiments* are commonly used to answer relational RQs (with a between-individuals comparison), but are not always possible.
An example of a true experiment is a *randomised controlled trial*, often used in drug trials.


::: {.definition #TrueExperiment name="True experiment"}
In a *true experiment*, the researchers:

1. allocate treatments to groups of individuals (i.e., determine the values of the explanatory for the individuals), *and*
2. determine who or what individuals are in those groups.

While these may not happen in these *explicit* steps, they can happen *conceptually*.
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3807629.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>



::: {.example name="True experiment"}
The echinacea study (Sect.\ \@ref(Writing-RQs)) could be designed as a *true experiment*.
The researchers would allocate individuals to one of two groups, and then decide which group took echinacea and which group did not (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TrueExpStudiesImage)).

These steps may happen implicitly: researchers may allocate each person at random to one of the two groups (echinacea; no echinacea).
This is still a true experiment, since the researchers could decide to switch which group receives echinacea; ultimately, the decision is still made by the researchers.
:::


```{r TrueExpStudiesImage, fig.cap="True experimental studies: researchers allocate individuals to groups, and treatments to groups", fig.align="center", fig.show="hold", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='65%'}
showStudyDesign(studyType = "TrueExp", 
                outcomeName = "duration of cold symptoms",
                addIndividuals = TRUE,
                addCNames = c("Echinacea",   
                              "No echinacea"))
```




### Quasi-experimental studies {#QuasiExperiments}
\index{Study types!experimental!quasi}

Quasi-experiments are similar to true experiments (i.e., answer relational RQs)  where treatments are *allocated* to groups that *already exist* (e.g., may be naturally occurring).


::: {.definition #QuasiExperiment name="Quasi-experiment"}
In a *quasi-experiment*, the researchers:
  
1. allocate treatments to groups of individuals (i.e., allocate the values of the explanatory variable to the individuals), but
2. do *not* determine who or what individuals are in those groups.
:::
      

::: {.example #QuasiEchinacea name="Quasi-experiments"}
The echinacea study (Sect.\ \@ref(Writing-RQs)) could be designed as a quasi-experiment.
The researchers could *find* (not *create*) two existing groups of people (say, from Suburbs\ A and\ B), then decide to allocate people in Suburb\ A to take echinacea, and people in Suburb\ B to *not* take echinacea (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:QuasiExpStudiesImage)).
:::


```{r QuasiExpStudiesImage, fig.cap="Quasi-experimental studies: researchers do not allocate individuals to groups, but do allocate treatments to groups. The dashed lines indicate steps not under the control of the researchers.", fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, out.width='65%'}
showStudyDesign(studyType = "QuasiExp",
                outcomeName = "duration of cold symptoms",
                addIndividuals = TRUE,  
                addCNames = c("Echinacea",   
                              "No echinacea"))
```


::: {.example #QuasiAlcoholAwareness name="Quasi-experiments"}
A researcher wants to examine the effect of an alcohol awareness program [@macdonald2008enough] on the average amount of alcohol consumed per student in a university Orientation Week.
She runs the program at University A only, then compares the average amount of alcohol consumed per person at two universities (A and\ B).

This study is a *quasi-experiment* since the researcher did not (and can not) determine the groups: the students (not the researcher) would have chosen University\ A or University\ B for many reasons.
However, the researcher *did* decide whether to allocate the program to University\ A or University\ B.
:::



## Comparing study types {#CompareStudyTypes}
\index{Study types!compared}

Different RQs require different study designs.
In *experimental* studies, researchers *create* differences in the values of the explanatory variable through allocation, and then note the effect this has on the values of the response variable.
In *observational* studies, researchers *observe* differences in the values of the explanatory variable, and observe the values of the response variable.

Importantly, *only well-designed true experiments can show cause-and-effect*.
Nonetheless, well-designed observational and quasi-experimental studies can provide evidence to support cause-and-effect conclusions, especially when supported by other evidence.
Although only experimental studies can show cause-and-effect, experimental studies are often not possible for ethical, financial, practical or logistical reasons.

The advantages and disadvantages of each study type are discussed later (Sect.\ \@ref(InterpretStudyDesign)), after these study types are discussed in greater detail in the following chapters.

::: {.example #Autism name="Cause and effect"}
Many studies report that the bacteria in the gut of people on the autism spectrum is different than the bacteria in the gut of people *not* on the autism spectrum (@kang2019long, @ho2020gut), and suggest the bacteria may contribute whether a person is autistic.
These studies were observational, so the\index{Cause and effect}

Other studies [@yap2021autism] suggest that people on the autism spectrum are more likely to be 'picky eaters', which contributes to the differences in gut bacteria.

## Directionality {#Directionality}
\index{Study types!directionality}

Analytical research studies (observational; experimental) can be classified by their *directionality* (Table\ \@ref(tab:TypesOfObsStudies)):

* [*Forward direction*](#ForwardStudies): 
  The values of the explanatory variable are obtained, and the study determines what values of the response variable occur in the future.
  *All experimental studies have a forward direction.*
* [*Backward direction*](#BackwardStudies): 
  The values of the response variable are obtained, then the study determines what values of the explanatory variable occurred in the past.
* [*No direction*](#NondirectionalStudies): 
  The values of the response and explanatory variables are obtained at the same time.

Directionality is important for understanding cause-and-effect relationships.
If the comparison occurs *before* the outcome is observed, a cause-and-effect relationship *may* be possible.
That is, studies with a forward direction are more likely to provide evidence of causality.


```{r TypesOfObsStudies}
ObsStudies <- array( dim = c(3, 3) )
colnames(ObsStudies) <- c("Type", 
                          "Explanatory variable",
                          "Response variable")

ObsStudies[1, ] <- c("Forward direction",

::: {.example name="Directionality"}
In South Australia in 1988--1989, $25$ cases of legionella infections (an unusually high number) were investigated [@data:oconnor:pottingmix].
All $25$ cases were gardeners.

Researchers compared $25$ people with legionella infections with $75$ similar people without the infection.
The use of potting mix in the previous four weeks was associated with an increase in the risk of contracting illness of about $4.7$ times.

This study has a backward *direction*: people were identified with an infection, and then the researchers looked *back* at past activities.

Research studies are sometimes described as 'prospective'\index{Study types!prospective} or 'retrospective',\index{Study types!prospective} but these terms can be misleading [@ranganathan2018study] and their use not recommended [@VANDENBROUCKE20141500].


*Experimental studies always have a forward direction.*
Observational studies may have any directionality, and are sometimes given different names accordingly.


### Forward-directional studies {#Forward}
\index{Study types!directionality!forward}

All experimental studies have a forward direction, and include *randomised controlled trials* (RCTs) and *clinical trials*.\index{Clinical trials}\index{Randomised controlled trials}

Observational studies with a *forward* direction are often called *cohort studies*.\index{Cohort studies}
Both experimental studies and cohort studies can be expensive and tricky: tracking a group of individuals (a *cohort*) into the future is not always easy, and the ability to track some individuals into the future may be lost (*drop-outs*)\index{drop-outs} as (for example) plants or animals die, or people move or decide to no longer participate, etc.
Forward-directional observational studies:

* may add support to cause-and-effect conclusions, since the comparison occurs *before* the outcome (only well-designed experimental studies can establish cause-and-effect).
* can examine many different outcomes in one study, since the outcome(s) occur in the future. 
* can be problematic for rare outcomes, as the outcome of interest may not appear (or may appear rarely) in the future.



::: {.example name="Forward study"}
@chih2018incidence studied dogs and cats who had been recommended to receive intermittent nasogastric tube (NGT) aspiration for up to $36$\ hrs.
Some pet owners did not give permission for NGT, while some did; thus, whether the animal received NGT was *not* determined by the researchers (so this study is observational).
The researchers then observed whether the animals developed hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (HCMA) in the next $36$\ hrs.

Since the explanatory variable (whether NGT was used or not) was recorded at the start of the study, and the response variable (whether HCMA was observed or not) was determined within the following $36$\ hrs, this study has a *forward direction*.
:::


### Backward-directional studies {#Backward}
\index{Study types!directionality!backward}

Observational studies with a *backward* direction are often called *case-control* studies.\index{Case-control studies}
Researchers find individuals with specific values of the response variable (the cases and the controls), and determine values of the explanatory variable from the past.
Case-control studies:

* only allow one outcome to be studied, since individuals are chosen to be in the study based on the value of the response variable of interest.
* are useful for rare outcomes: the researchers can purposely select large numbers with the rare outcome of interest.
* do not effectively eliminate other explanations for the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (called *confounding*; Def.\ \@ref(def:Confounding)).
* may suffer from *selection bias* (Sect.\ \@ref(SelectionBias)), as researchers try to locate individuals with a rare outcome.\index{Bias!selection}
* may suffer from *recall bias* (Sect.\ \@ref(Biases)) when the individuals are people: accurately recalling the past can be unreliable.\index{Bias!recall}

::: {.example name="Backwards study"}
A study [@data:Pamphlett:toxins] examined patients with and without sporadic motor neurone disease (SMND), and asked about *past* exposure to metals.

The response variable (whether or not the respondent had SMND) is assessed when the study begins, and whether or not they had exposure to metals (explanatory variable) is determined from the *past*.
This observational study has a *backward* direction.
:::


### Non-directional studies {#NonDirectional}
\index{Study types!directionality!non-directional}

*Non-directional* observational studies are called *cross-sectional* studies.\index{Cross-sectional studies}
Cross-sectional studies:

* are good for findings associations between variables (which may or may not be causation).
* are generally quicker and cheaper than other types of studies.
* are not useful for studying rare outcomes.
* do not effectively eliminate other explanations for the relationship between the response and explanatory variables (called *confounding*; Def.\ \@ref(def:Confounding)).



::: {.example name="Non-directional study"}
A study [@data:Russell2014:FoodInsecurity] asked older Australian their opinions of their own food security, and recorded their living arrangements.
Individuals' responses to both both the response variable and explanatory variable were gathered at the same time.
This observational study is *non-directional*.
:::


## Internal validity {#IntroInternalValidity}
\index{Internal validity}

Well-designed studies allow the researchers to focus on the relationship of interest, and to eliminate other possible explanations for changes in the value of the response variable apart from this relationship.
A study which does this is said to have good *internally validity*.


::: {.definition #InternalValidity name="Internal validity"}
*Internally validity* refers to the extent to which a cause-and-effect relationship can be established in a study, that cannot be otherwise explained.

A study with *high* internal validity shows that the changes in the response variable can be attributed to changes in the explanatory variables; other explanations have been ruled out.
:::


Studies with *high* internal validity show that changes in the response variable can confidently be related to changes in the explanatory variable *in the group that was studied*; the possibility of other explanations has been minimised.

In contrast, studies with *low* internal validity leave open other possibilities, apart from changes in value of the explanatory variable, to explain changes in the value of the response variable.
Experimental studies usually have higher internal validity than observational studies.

Ideally, all studies should be designed to be *internally valid* as far as possible.
For this reason, internal validity is studied in more detail in Chaps.\ \@ref(DesignExperiment) (for exerimental studies) and \@ref(DesignObservational) (for observational studies).


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-door-7-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>



::: {.example #LowInternal name="Low internal validity"}
In a review of studies that used double-fortified salt to manage iodine and iron deficiencies [@larson2021can], one conclusion was (p.\ 265):

> Internal validity of the efficacy trials was generally weak [...] because of issues around selection bias, unaccounted confounders, and participant withdrawals.
:::


One of many potential threats to internal validity is that the groups being compared are initially different; for example, the group receiving echinacea is younger (on average) than the group receiving no medication.
This is a form of *confounding* (Def.\ \@ref(def:Confounding)).

The comparison groups are often compared at the start of the study: the groups being compared should be as similar as possible, so that any differences in the outcome cannot be attributed to pre-existing difference in the groups.


::: {.example name="Baseline characteristics"}
In a study of treating depression in adults [@data:Danielsson2014:Depression], three treatments were compared: exercise, basic body awareness therapy, or advice.

If any differences in the patients receiving the different treatments were found, the researchers need to be confident that the differences were due to the treatment.
For this reason, the three groups were compared to ensure the groups were similar in terms of average ages, percentage of women, taking of anti-depressants, and many other aspects.
::: 


An *internally valid* study requires studies to be carefully designed, as discussed in Chaps.\ \@ref(DesignExperiment) and\ \@ref(DesignObservational).
In general, well-designed experimental studies are more likely to be internally valid than observational studies.


## External validity {#IntroExternalValidity}
\index{External validity}

Apart from being internally valid, the conclusions from the study of a *sample* should apply to the intended *population*.
This is called *external validity*.

A study is *externally valid* if the results of the study are likely to generalise to the rest of the *population*, beyond just those studied in the sample.
To be *externally* valid, a study first needs to be *internally* valid, since the results must at least be sound for the group under study before being extended to other members of the population.

Using a *random sample* helps ensure external validity.\index{Samplin!random}
In addition, the use of [*inclusion* and *exclusion criteria*](#def:InclusionExclusionCriteria) (Sect.\ \@ref(Population)) helps clarify to whom or what the results may apply.


<div style="float:right; width: 75px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-share-11-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #ExternalValidity name="External validity"}
*External validity* refers to the ability to generalise the results to the rest of the population, beyond just those in the sample studied.
For a study to be truly externally valid, the sample must be a random sample (Chap.\ \@ref(Sampling)) from the population.
:::


*External validity* does *not* mean that the results apply more widely than the intended population.


::: {.example #ExternalValidPop name="External validity"}
Suppose the *population* in a study is *Californian university students*.
The sample comprises the Californian university students actually studied by the researchers.
The study is externally valid if the sample is a random sample from the population of all Californian university students.

The results will not necessarily apply to university students outside of Californian (though they may), or all Californian residents.
However, this *is irrelevant for external validity*.
External validity concerns how the *sample* represents the intended population in the RQ, which is *Californian university students*.
The study is not concerned with all Californian residents, or with non-Californian university students.
:::


## The importance of design {#DesignImportance}

Choosing the *type* of study is only one part of research design.
Planning the data collection process, and actually collecting the data, is still required.
Sometimes, data may be already available (called *secondary data*), and sometimes it may need collecting (called *primary data*).

Either way, *how* the data are obtained is important.
The design phase is concerned with planning the best approach to obtaining the data, to ensure the study is *internally* and *externally* valid, as far as possible.

Designing a study to maximise *internal validity* means:

* identifying *what else* might influence the values of the response variable, apart from the explanatory variable (Chap.\ \@ref(FactorsInfluenceY)); and
* designing the study to be *effective* (Chaps.\ \@ref(DesignExperiment) and\ \@ref(DesignObservational)).

Designing a study to maximise *external validity* means:

* identifying who or what to study, since the whole population cannot be studied (Chap.\ \@ref(Sampling)); and
* determining *how many* individuals to study.
  (We need to learn more before we can answer this critical question in Chap.\ \@ref(EstimatingSampleSize).)

The details of how the data will be *collected* (Chap.\ \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures)) and *ethical* issues (Chap.\ \@ref(Ethics)) must also be considered.
Furthermore, the limitations of the study must be communicated (Chap.\ \@ref(Interpretation)).

## Chapter summary {#Chap3-Summary}

Three types of research studies are: *Descriptive studies* (for descriptive RQs), *observational studies* (for relational or repeated-measures RQs *without* an intervention), and *experimental* (for relational or repeated-measures RQs  *with* an intervention).

Observational studies can be classified as having a *forward direction* (cohort studies), *backward direction* (case-control studies), or *no direction* (cross-sectional studies).
Experimental studies always have a forward direction.
Relational RQs with an intervention can be classified as *true experiments* or *quasi-experiments*.
Cause-and-effect conclusions can only be made from well-designed *true experiments*.

Ideally studies should be designed to be *internally* and *externally* valid.
In general, experimental studies have better internal validity than observational studies.

## Quick review questions {#Chap3-QuickReview}

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}
1. A study [@fraboni2018red] examined the 'red-light running behaviour of cyclists in Italy'. \tightlist
This study is most likely to be: `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()){
'  (a) an observational study; (b) a quasi-experimental study; or (c) an experimental study.'
}`
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
	longmcq( c(answer = "an observational study",
             "a quasi-experimental study",
             "an experimental study"))}`
1. When the results of studying a sample apply to the wider population of interest, the study is called:  `r if( !knitr::is_html_output() ) {' (a) internally valid; or (b) externally valid.'}`
`r if(knitr::is_html_output()){
	longmcq( c("internally valid",
              answer = "externally valid") ) }`
1. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers allocate treatments to groups that they cannot manipulate. 
True or false?
`r if(knitr::is_html_output())	torf(answer=TRUE)`
1. What is the difference between an true experiment and a quasi-experiment? \tightlist
 `r if (!knitr::is_html_output()){
'  a. In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers do not apply treatments to groups. 
   b. In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have determined. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have not determined.
   c. In a true experiment, the RQ has a comparison; in a quasi-experiment, the RQ does not have a comparison.'
}`
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
   longmcq( c(
      "In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers do not apply treatments to groups", 
      answer = "In a true experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have determined. In a quasi-experiment, the researchers apply treatments to groups that they have not determined",
      "In a true experiment, the RQ has a comparison; in a quasi-experiment, the RQ does not have a comparison."))}` 
1. Which of the following are true?

   a. True experiments generally have a higher internal validity than observational studies.  \tightlist
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( answer = TRUE)}`
   b. Internal validity refers to the strength of the inferences made from the study.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( answer = TRUE)}`
   c. External validity refers to the ability to generalise the results to other groups apart from those studied.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( answer = TRUE)}`
   d. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be used to clarify the internal validity.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( answer = FALSE)}`
   e. Observational studies have a higher external validity than experimental studies.  
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( answer = FALSE)}`

## Exercises {#ResearchDesignsExercises}

Selected answers are available in Sect.\ \@ref(ResearchDesignAnswer).


:::{.exercise #TypesOfDesignsAcuteOtitis}
Consider this RQ [@data:McLinn:otitis]:

> In children with acute otitis media, what is the difference in the average duration of symptoms when treated with cefuroxime compared to amoxicillin?

1. Is the comparison a within- or between-individuals comparsion?
1. Is this RQ relational, repeated-measures or correlational?
1. Is there likely an intervention?
1. Is the RQ an estimation or decision-making RQ?
1. Is the study observational or experimental?
   If observational, what is the *direction*?
   If experiment, is this a quasi-experiment or true experiment?
:::



::: {.exercise #TypesOfDesignsWorms}
A study [@data:Khair2015:Earthworms] studied the time needed for organic waste to turn into compost.
For some batches of compost, earthworms were added.
In other batches, earthworms were *not* added to the waste.

One RQs asked whether the composting times for waste with and without earthworms was the same or not. 

1. Is the comparison a within- or between-individuals comparsion?
1. Is this RQ relational, repeated-measures or correlational?
1. Is there an intervention?
1. Is the RQ an estimation or decision-making RQ?
1. Is the study observational or experimental?
   If observational, what is the *direction*?
   If experiment, is this a quasi-experiment or true experiment?

::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignConcreteBeams}
In a  study on the shear strength of recycled concrete beams [@gonzalez2007shear], beams were divided into three groups.
Different loads were then applied to each group, and the shear strength needed to fracture the beams was measured.
Is this a *quasi-experiment* or a *true experiment*? 
Explain.
:::


::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignVAP}
A research study compared the use of two different education programs to reduce the percentage of patients experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Paramedics from two cities were chosen to participate. 
Paramedics in City\ A were chosen to receive Program\ 1, and paramedics in the other city to receive Program\ 2.

1. Is this RQ relational, repeated-measures or correlational?
1. Is the comparison a within- or between-individuals comparsion?
1. Is there likely an intervention?
1. Is the study observational or experimental?
   If observational, what is the *direction*?
   If experiment, is this a quasi-experiment or true experiment?
:::



::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignMatresses}
A nursing study aimed to compare 'the effectiveness of alternating pressure air mattresses vs. overlays, to prevent pressure ulcers' (@data:Manzano2013:Matresses, p.\ 2099).
Patients were *provided* with either alternating pressure air overlays (in 2001) or alternating pressure air mattresses (in 2006).
The number of pressure ulcers were recorded.

This study is experimental, because the researchers *provided* the mattresses.
Is this a *true* experiment or *quasi*-experiment?
Explain.
:::




::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignPetsAndHealth}
Consider this initial RQ (based on @friedmann1985health), that clearly requires a lot of refining: 'Are people with pets healthier?'
To answer this RQ:

1. Briefly describe useful and practical definitions for P, O and C. 
2. Briefly describe an *experimental* study to answer the RQ.
3. Briefly describe an *observational* study to answer the RQ.
:::


::: {.exercise #ResearchDesignDietsForWeightLoss}
Consider this journal article extract (@data:sacks:weightloss, p.\ 859):

> We randomly assigned $811$ overweight adults to one of four diets [...]
> The diets consisted of similar foods and met guidelines for cardiovascular health [...]
> The primary outcome was the change in body weight after $2$ years in [...] comparisons of low fat versus high fat and average protein versus high protein and in the comparison of highest and lowest carbohydrate content.

1. What is the *between*-individuals comparison?
1. What is the *within*-individuals comparison?
1. Is this study observational or experimental?
   Why?
1. Is this study a quasi-experiment or a true experiment?
   Why?
1. What are the units of analysis?
1. What are the units of observation?
1. What is the response variable?
1. What is the explanatory variable?
