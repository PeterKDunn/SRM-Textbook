## Introduction {#CompareQual-Intro}

Relational RQs compare groups.
This chapter considers how to compare *qualitative* variables in different groups.
Tables and graphs are useful this purpose.

## Two-way tables {#QualitativeTwoWaytables}
\index{Two-way tables}

When more than one qualitative variable is recorded for each individual, the data can be collated into table.
When *two* qualitative variables are cross-tabulated, the resulting table is called a *two-way table*.\index{Tables!two-way}
As always, the categories for each variable should be *exhaustive*\index{Exhaustive} (cover all levels) and *mutually exclusive*\index{Mutually exclusive} (observations belong to one and only one level).

::: {#SmallKidneyStones .example name="Two-way tables"}
@data:Charig:stones compared two treatments for kidney stones to determine which had a higher success rate.
Data were collected from $700$\ UK patients, on two qualitative variables:

-   the treatment method ('A' or\ 'B'): the explanatory variable.
-   the result of the procedure ('success' or\ 'failure'): the response variable.

Both variables are *qualitative* with two *levels*, and each treatment was used on $350$ patients.
Treatment\ A was used from 1972--1980, and Treatment\ B from 1980--1985; that is, *treatments were not randomly* allocated, and so *confounding* may be present.
For this reason, the researchers also recorded the *size* of the kidney stone ('small' or 'large') as one possible confounding variable.
Firstly, consider just the *small stones* [@julious1994confounding], displayed in the two-way table in Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small).

## Summary tables by rows and columns {#RowPercentages}
\index{Two-way tables!by rows}\index{Two-way tables!by columns}

Each variable in a two-way table can be analysed separately, using percentages or proportions (Sect.\ \@ref(QualitativeProportionsPercentages)) or odds (Sect.\ \@ref(QualOdds)).
For example, the two variables in Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small) (Method; Result) can be analysed separately:

- The percentage of procedures that were successful is $315/357\times 100 = 88.2$%.
- The odds that a procedure was successful is $315/42 = 7.5$; that is, there were\ $7.5$ times as many successful procedures as unsuccessful procedures.

However, to *compare* Methods\ A and\ B, these odds and percentages (or proportions) can be computed for each row (or column) separately.


::: {#SummaryTableCompareQual .example name="Large kidney stones"}
The data in Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small) can be summarised by computing *proportions* or *percentages* by *row*.
The rows refer to the different Methods, so this will compare success percentages for the two methods.

For the small kidney stones (Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small)), the *row percentages* 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {    
'(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KidneyRowColLATEX), left table)'
} else {
'(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KS-Small-rowPC)' }` 
give the proportion of successes for each *Method*, since the rows represent the counts for Methods\ A and\ B.\xspace\index{Proportions} 
*Row* proportions allow the proportions *within the rows* (i.e., for each Method) to be compared:

-   Method\ A: $81 \div 87 = 0.931$ (or\ $93.1$%) of operations in the sample were successful.
-   Method\ B: $234\div 270 = 0.867$ (or\ $86.7$%) of operations in the sample were successful.

For small kidney stones, Method\ A is slightly more successful\ ($93.1$%) than Method\ B\ ($86.7$%) in the *sample*.
These percentages are collated in\index{Percentages} 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {    
'Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KidneyRowColLATEX) (left table).' } else 
{    
'Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KS-Small-rowPC).' 
}`

Odds can also be computed:\index{Odds}

-   Method\ A: The odds of success is $81/6 = 13.5$: there are $13.5$ more successful procedures than failures for Method\ A.
-   Method\ B: The odds of success is $234/36 = 6.5$: there are $6.5$ more successful procedures than failures for Method\ B.

The odds of a success is far greater for Method\ A than Method\ B in the sample.

Rather than comparing *methods* (in the rows), the procedure *results* can be compared (i.e., the columns).


::: {#KidneyStonesSmallColums .example name="Comparing by column"}
For the *small* kidney stones (Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small)), the *column proportions* `r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {    '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KidneyRowColLATEX), right table)' } else {    '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KS-Small-colPC)' }` give the proportion of successes within each column (i.e., for successes and for failures), since the columns contain the procedure results.
*Column* proportions allow the proportions (or percentages) within *columns* to be compared:

- The proportion of the *successful* procedures that were from Method\ A is $81 \div 315 = 0.257$ (or\ $25.7$%).
- The proportion of the *failed* procedures that were from Method\ A is $234\div 315 = 0.143$ (or\ $14.3$%).

Odds can also be computed:

- The odds of a *success* coming from Method\ A is $81/234 = 0.346$: there are $0.346$\ more Method\ A procedures than Method\ B procedures among the successes.
- The odds of *failure* coming from Method\ A is $6/36 = 0.167$: there are $0.167$\ more Method\ A procedures than Method\ B procedures among the failures.

The odds of a success being a Method\ A procedure is quite different from the odds of a success being a Method\ B procedure.

Comparing rows (i.e., using row percentages and row odds) seem more intuitive than column percentages here: they compare the success percentage for each method.

## Graphs for the comparison {#QualitativeCompareGraphs}
\index{Qualitative data!compare \textit{between} individuals!graphs}\index{Software output!graphs}

When a *qualitative* variable is compared across different groups (i.e., comparing between individuals), options for plotting include:

-   *Stacked bar charts* (Sect.\ \@ref(StackedBarCharts));
-   *Side-by-side bar charts* (Sect.\ \@ref(SideBySideBarCharts)); or
-   *Dot charts* (Sect.\ \@ref(TwoWayCountsDotCharts)).


### Stacked bar charts {#StackedBarCharts}
\index{Graphs!stacked bar chart}

The data can be graphed by using a bar for each level of one variable, and *stacking* the bars for the levels of the second variable.
Bars indicate the counts (or percentages) in each category.
The levels can be on the horizontal or vertical axis, but placing the level names on the vertical axis often makes for easier reading, and room for long labels. 


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The axis displaying the counts (or percentages) should *start from zero*, since the height of the bars visually implies the frequency of those observations (see Example\ \@ref(exm:VerticalTruncation)).
:::



::: {#BarStacked .example name="Stacked bar charts"}
For the kidney-stone data in Example\ \@ref(exm:SmallKidneyStones), a stacked bar chart can be created by producing a bar for each method, and *stacking* the successes and failures for each method (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:QualGraphsStones), top left panel).

Rather than using *numbers*, the *percentages* separately within each group can be used too (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:QualGraphsStones), bottom left panel).

### Side-by-side bar charts {#SideBySideBarCharts}
\index{Graphs!side-by-side bar chart}

Instead of stacking the success and failures bars on top of each other, these bars can be placed *side-by-side* for each method.
Bars indicate the counts (or percentages) in each category.
The levels can be on the horizontal or vertical axis, but placing the level names on the vertical axis often makes for easier reading, and room for long labels. 


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The axis displaying the counts (or percentages) should *start from zero*, since the height of the bars visually implies the frequency of those observations (see Example\ \@ref(exm:VerticalTruncation)).
:::


::: {#BarSideBySide .example name="Side-by-side bar charts"}
For the kidney-stone data in Example\ \@ref(exm:SmallKidneyStones), a side-by-side bar chart can be created by producing two bars for each method (one for failures; one for successes), and placing these side-by-side (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:QualGraphsStones), centre panels).
Again, numbers or percentages within each method can be graphed.

\index{Graphs!dot chart!comparing qualitative data}

Instead of bars, dots (or other symbols) can be used in place of the bars in a side-by-side bar chart.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The axis displaying the counts (or percentages) should *start from zero*, since the distance of the dots from the axis visually implies the frequency of those observations (see Example\ \@ref(exm:VerticalTruncation)).
:::


::: {#BarSideBySide2 .example name="Side-by-side bar charts"}
For the data in Example\ \@ref(exm:SmallKidneyStones), a dot chart can be created by placing plotting symbols for each result (one for failures; one for successes) side-by-side for each method (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:QualGraphsStones), right panels).
Again, numbers or percentages can be used.
:::

### Other variations {#OtherVariations}

Many variations of these charts are possible, by making different choices:

- Using a stacked bar chart, side-by-side bar chart, or dot chart.
- Using percentages or counts on one axis. 
(The percentages can be percentages of the total, or within the total for each level of the variable, as in the bottom plots in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:QualGraphsStones).)
- Using the counts (or percentage) on either the horizontal or vertical axis.
- Deciding which variable can be used as the first division of the data.

The guiding principle remains: *the purpose of a graph is to display the information in the clearest, simplest possible way, to facilitate understanding the message(s) in the data*.

Using a computer to create graphs is recommended, and using a computer makes it easy to try different variations to find the graph that best displays the message in the data.


## Numerical summary: difference between proportions {#DiffProportions}
\index{Difference between proportions}\index{Software output!compare two proportions}\index{Summary table!compare two proportions}\index{Summary table!compare two odds}

The small kidney-stone data (Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small)) can be summarised using proportions (or percentages):

-   *Method\ A*: the proportion of successful procedures is $0.931$ (or, the percentages of successful procedures is\ $93.1$%).
-   *Method\ B*: the proportion of successful procedures is $0.867$ (or, the percentages of successful procedures is\ $86.7$%).

The *difference* between these proportions is\ $0.064$ (or\ $6.4$ percentage points).
The difference between the proportions is a *statistic*, and the (unknown) difference between the population proportions is a *parameter*.


## Numerical summary: odds ratios {#OddsRatios}
\index{Odds ratio}

The small kidney stone data (Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small)) can be summarised using odds:

-   *Method\ A*: the odds of success are\ $13.5$ ($13.5$\ *times* as many successes as failures).
-   *Method\ B*: the odds of success are\ $6.5$ ($6.5$\ *times* as many successes as failures).

The odds of success for Method\ A and Method\ B are very different.
In the sample, the odds of success for Method\ A is many *times* greater than for Method\ B.\spacex 
In fact, in the sample, the odds of success for Method\ A is $13.5\div 6.5 = 2.08$ *times* the odds of a success for Method\ B.\spacex
This value is the *odds ratio* (OR).
The sample odds ratio is a *statistic*, and the (unknown) population odds ratio is a *parameter*.

::: {#OddsRatio .definition name="Odds Ratio (OR)"}
The *odds ratio* (often written OR) is the ratio of the odds of a result of interest in one group, compared to the odds of the *same* result in a *different* group:
$$
\text{Odds ratio} = 
\frac{\text{Odds of a result in Group A}}
{\text{Odds of the same result in Group B}}.
$$
:::



::: {#InterpretingOdds .example name="Odds ratios"}
For the small kidney-stone data, the odds of a success for Method\ A is $81\div6 = 13.5$.
The odds of a success for Method\ B is $234\div36 = 6.5$.
The odds ratio is then computed as $13.5\div 6.5 = 2.08$.
The odds have been computed *with the rows*.

This means that the odds of a success for Method\ A is about\ $2.08$ times the odds of a success for Method\ B.
:::

Most software computes the odds ratio from a two-way table by using the values in the *first* row and *first* column on the *top* of the fractions when computing the odds and the odds ratio.
In Example\ \@ref(exm:InterpretingOdds), for instance, the odds for both methods were computed with the Column\ 1 values on the top of the fraction ($81$ and\ $234$), and the odds ratio comparing the *rows* was computed with the Row\ 1 odds ($13.5$) on top of the fraction.

However, the odds ratio could also be computed using the odds within the columns (i.e., comparing the *columns*), rather than within the rows (as in Example\ \@ref(exm:ComputingOddsFractions)).


::: {#ComputingOddsFractions .example name="Odds ratios"}
For the small kidney stone data, the odds of a *success* coming from Method\ A (i.e., Column\ 1) is $81/234 = 0.3462$.
Likewise, the odds of a *failure* (i.e., Column\ 2) coming from Method\ A is $6\div36 =  0.1667$.
The odds ratio is  $0.3462\div 0.1667 = 2.08$, as in Example\ \@ref(exm:InterpretingOdds).
This means that the odds of Method\ A producing a success is about\ $2.08$ times the odds of Method\ A producing a failure.

The two odds ratio calculations produce the same value.
The odds ratio can be interpreted in either way: as in this example or as in Example\ \@ref(exm:InterpretingOdds).
*Both interpretations are correct.*
:::


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
The odds ratio can be interpreted in *either* of these ways (i.e., both are correct):\index{Odds ratio!interpreting}\index{Software output!comparing two odds (odds ratio)}

-   The *odds* compare Row\ 1 counts to Row\ 2 counts, for both columns.
The *odds ratio* then compares the Column\ 1 odds to the Column\ 2 odds.
-   The *odds* compare Column\ 1 counts to Column\ 2 counts.
The *odds ratio* then compares the Row\ 1 odds to the Row\ 2 odds.

Odds and odds ratios are computed with the *first row* and *first column* values on the *top* of the fraction.
While both are correct, one way usually makes more sense.
:::


The OR compares the odds of the same result (e.g., success) in two different groups (e.g., Method\ A and Method\ B).
This means that a $2\times 2$ table can be summarised using one number: the odds ratio (OR).

When interpreting odds ratios (or ORs):

- odds ratios *greater than*\ $1$ mean the odds of the result is *larger* for the group on top of the division compared to the group on the bottom.
- odds ratios *equal to*\ $1$ mean the odds of the result is the *same* for both groups (on the top and the bottom of the division).
- odds ratios *less than*\ $1$ mean the odds of the result is *smaller* for the group on the top of the division compared to the group on the bottom.

The data in Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small) are for procedures on *small* kidney stones.
Data were also recorded for the *large* kidney stones `r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {    '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KStonesNumbersLargeAll), left table).' } else {    '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KS-Large)).' }` 
As for small kidney stones, the *success percentages* can be computed for both methods:

-   *Method\ A*: Success proportion for *large* kidney stones: $192/263 = 0.730$, or\ $73.0$%.
-   *Method\ B*: Success proportion for *large* kidney stones: $55/80 = 0.688$, or\ $68.8$%.

For large kidney stones, then, *Method\ A* has a higher success proportion than Method\ B, just as with the small kidney stones.

(ref:KStonesNumbersLarge) *Counts* for two procedures with *large* kidney stones.

```{r KS-Large}
KS.large <- xtabs( Counts ~ Method + Result, 
                   data = subset(KStones, Size == "Large"))[, c(2, 1)]
KS.large2 <- cbind(KS.large, 
                   "Total" = rowSums(KS.large))

if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
  kable(pad(KS.large2,

            targetLength = c(3, 2, 3),
            decDigits = 0), 
        format = "html",
        longtable = FALSE,
        booktabs = TRUE,

        col.names = c("Success", 
                      "Failure",

        caption = "(ref:KStonesNumbersLarge)") %>%
    column_spec(column = 4, 
                bold = TRUE)

So, could the data for small (Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small)) and large kidney stones 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {    
'(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KStonesNumbersLargeAll), left table)' } else 
{    
'(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KS-Large))' }` 
be combined, to produce a single two-way table of just Method and Result 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {    
'(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KStonesNumbersLargeAll), right table),' } else
{    
'(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KSAll)),' }` 
From this table of small and large stones combined, 

-   *Method\ A*: Success proportion for *all* kidney stones: $273/350 = 0.780$, or\ $78.0$%.
-   *Method\ B*: Success proportion for *all* kidney stones: $289/350 = 0.826$, or\ $82.6$%.

(ref:KStonesNumbersAll) Counts from two procedures, when small and large kidney stones are combined.

```{r KSAll}

KS.all2 <- cbind(KS.all, 
                 "Total" = rowSums(KS.all))

When all kidney stones are combined, *Method\ A* has a *lower* success proportion than Method\ B.
So, to summarise:

-   *Method\ A* is more successful for *small* stones ($93.1$% vs\ $86.7$%);
-   *Method\ A* is more successful for *large* stones ($73.0$% vs\ $68.8$%); but
-   But *Method\ B* is more successful for *all* stones combined ($78.0$% vs\ $82.6$%).

That seems strange: Method\ A performs better for small *and* for large kidney stones, but Method\ B performs better when combing all kidney stones.
The explanation is that the *size of the stone* is a *confounding variable*\index{Variables!confounding} (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SimpsonRulesStones)).
Size is associated with both the method (small stones are treated more often with Method\ B) *and* with the result (small stones have a higher success proportion for *both* methods).

This confounding could have been avoided by randomly allocating a treatment method to patients.
However, random allocation was not possible in this study (which was observational), so the researchers used a different method to manage confounding: *recording* the size of the kidney stones to use in the analysis (see Sect.\ 
\@ref(ManagingConfounding)).\index{Confounding}\index{Variables!lurking}\index{Variables!confounding}\index{Confounding!analysis}

In this example, incorporating information about a potential confounder (the size of the kidney stone) is important, otherwise the wrong (opposite) conclusion is reached: Method\ B would be incorrectly considered better if the size of the stones was ignored, when the better method really is Method\ A.

This is called\index{Simpson's paradox} `r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {    "*Simpson's paradox*." } else {    "[*Simpson's paradox*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)." }`\index{Simpson's paradox}
If the size of the kidney stone had not been recorded, size would be a *lurking variable*, and the incorrect conclusion would have been reached.

## Example: water access {#WaterAcessQualCompare}

@lopez2022farmers recorded data about access to water for three rural communities in Cameroon (see Sects.\ \@ref(WaterAccessQuant) and\ \@ref(WaterAccessQual)).
The study could be used to determine contributors to the incidence of diarrhoea in young children ($85$\ households had children under\ $5$).
A cross-tabulation (Table\ \@ref(tab:WaterAcessQualCrosstab)) shows the relationship with keeping livestock; the numerical summary table (Table\ \@ref(tab:WaterAcessQualCompareTable)) may suggest a difference in the percentage of children with diarrhoea in households that do and do not keep livestock.
The comparison in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:WaterAccessQualCompare) includes some categories with small sample sizes, so the percentages shown may not be precise estimates\index{Precision} of the population values.

As usual, the data come from one of countless possible samples, but the RQ is about the population, so making a definitive decision is difficult.

## Chapter summary {#CompareQual-Summary}

Qualitative data can be compared between different groups (between individuals comparisons) using a stacked bar chart, side-by-side bar chart or a dot chart.
The data can be displayed in a two-way table, then summarised numerically by comparing proportions, percentages and odds.
The odds ratio (OR) and the difference between the proportions (or percentages) can be used to compare the two different groups.

::: {.exercise #SoccerHeaders}
Soccer is a unique in that one aspect is 'the purposeful use of the unprotected head for controlling and advancing the ball' [@kirkendall2001heading].
Some researchers suspect that repeatedly 'heading' the ball may impair brain function. 
A study [@kirkendall2001heading] was conducted to determine (p.\ 157)

> ...whether long-term or chronic neuropsychological dysfunction (i.e., concussion) was present in collegiate soccer players

Data were collected from\ $240$ college students for two variables:

* The student type:
One of 'soccer player' ($63$\ students), 'non-soccer athlete' ($96$ students), or 'non-athlete' ($81$\ students).
* The number of head concussions:
Each student was asked about the number of head concussions they had experienced; 'zero' ($158$\ students), 'one' ($45$\ students), or 'two or more' ($37$\ students) concussions.

Use the study data (Table\ \@ref(tab:SoccerTable)) to answer the following questions.


```{r SoccerTable, echo=FALSE}
SoccerTab <- array(dim=c(4, 4))
rownames(SoccerTab) <- c("Soccer players",

1. Classify the two variables.
2. Compute the percentage of college students in the *sample* overall that have received exactly one concussion.
3. Among the *non-athletes*, compute the odds of receiving two or more concussions.
Interpret what this means.
4. Among the *soccer players*, compute the odds of receiving two or more concussions.
Interpret what this means.
5. Compute the odds ratio comparing the odds of a non-athlete player receiving two or more concussions to the odds of a soccer player receiving two or more concussions.
6. Create a table of *column* percentages.
What do these tell you?
7. Create a table of *row* percentages.
What do these tell you?
8. Which one of these tables is probably more sensible, and why?
