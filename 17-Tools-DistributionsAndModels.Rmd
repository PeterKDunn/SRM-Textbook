## Introduction {#Chap17-Intro}

In the [decision-making process used in statistics](#DecisionMaking), an *assumption* is made about a parameter of the population.
And, of course, many different samples could be drawn from this population, and so the sample statistic can vary.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Remember: Studying a sample leads to the following observations:

* Each sample is likely to be different.
* Our sample is just one of countless possible samples from the population.
* Each sample is likely to produce a different value for the sample statistic.
* Hence we only observe one of the many possible values for the sample statistic.

Since many values for the sample statistic are possible, the possible values of the sample statistic vary (called *sampling variation*) and have a *distribution* (called a *sampling distribution*).
:::


Based on the assumption about the parameter, we can describe the values of the statistic that we would *expect* from these all possible samples.
Of course, we only study *one* of these many possible samples.

The *expectations* about the sample statistic are based on how the statistic (such as a sample mean, or a sample proportion, or a sample odds ratio) is [*distributed*](#GraphsOneQuant): that is, what values it can take from different samples, and how often.

A *model* is used to describe this *sampling* [*distribution*](#GraphsOneQuant).
For example, if I deal 15 cards, the *statistic* could be 'the proportion of red cards in a hand of 15'.
The *model* would describe how often we would see a proportion of 0/15 red cards, 1/15 red cards, 2/15 red cards... up to 15/15 red cards (Sect. \@ref(MakingDecisionsInResearch)).

Under [certain circumstances](#ValidityProportions), many sample statistics have a similar-shaped distribution: a *bell-shaped (or normal) distribution* (Sect. \@ref(NormalDistributions)).
We now study this distribution, as it often is the basis for describing what values the statistic can be *expected* to take, based on the initial *assumption* about the population.



## Distributions: an example

Consider the heights of *all* Australian adult males (the population).
Clearly, the height of *all* Australian adult males is unknown: no-one has ever, or could ever realistically, measure the height of every Australian adult male.
The
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS),'
} else {
   '[Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4338.0main+features212011-13),'
}`
however, takes samples of Australians to finds heights and other measurements.

A model could be *assumed* for the heights of the population of Australian adult males.
A model is a *theoretical* idea that might be a useful description of the heights of Australian adult males in the *population*.
Suppose a *model* for the heights of Australian adult males is adopted that describes the heights as:

* having a bell-shaped (normal) distribution,
* with a *mean height* of 175cm, and 
* a *standard deviation* of 7cm. 

Then, the *distribution* of the heights of Australian adult males would look like Fig. \@ref(fig:HeightsModel) (left panel).
That is, most Australian adult males are between about 168 and 182cm, and very few are taller than 196cm or shorter than 154cm.

```{r HeightsModel, echo=FALSE, out.width='95%', results='hide', fig.cap="A model for the heights of Australian adult males, showing 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations either side of the mean (left); the model for heights of Australian adult males, plus the histogram from one specific sample of size $n = 100$ of Australian adult males (right)", fig.align="center", fig.width=7.75, fig.height=2.5}

Since we do not know the heights of all Australian men, this model represents an idealised, or *assumed*, picture of the histogram of the heights of all Australian adult males in the *population*.
If this model is accurate, the distribution of heights in any *sample* may be shaped a bit like this... but *sampling variation* will exist, and every sample will be a bit different.

While any one sample will look a bit different than this model, the model captures the general feel of the histogram from many of these samples.
The model is like the 'average' of many sample histograms.
For example,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Fig. \\@ref(fig:HeightsModel) (right panel) shows a histogram from *one* sample of $n = 100$ men (the online version has an animation), but every sample will be different.'
} else {
   'see the animation below, where many samples of $n = 100$ men are taken.'
}`

The model of heights has approximately a bell-shape: that is, most values are near the average height, but a small number of men are very tall or very short.
A *bell-shaped distribution* is formally called a *normal distribution* or a *normal model*.
A normal distribution is a way of *modelling* the population.
			
A *model* is a theoretical or ideal concept.
In the same way that a model skeleton isn't 100% accurate and certainly not exactly like *your* skeleton, it suitably approximates reality.
None of us probably have a skeleton *exactly* like the model, but the model is still useful and helpful.

Likewise, no variable has *exactly* a normal distribution, but the model is still useful and helpful.
The model is a *theoretical* way of describing the distribution in the population; it does not represent any particular sample of data.
The model can be thought of as an 'average' of the histograms of the data from many samples.

Indeed, if this model turns out to be poor at describing what appears in samples, the [*parameters*](#StatisticsAndParameters) of the model (the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$) can be adjusted so the model *does* describe the sample data well.
In fact, evidence suggests that the average height of Australians has been increasing [@loesch2000secular] and so the mean of the model may need to be changed to  remain a good model.

A model is like an educated guess of the unknown population, based on sample information.
For the heights of Australian males, then, a suitable model may be an approximately normal shape, with a mean height of $\mu = 175$cm, and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 7$ cm. 


## About normal distributions {#NormalDistribution}

All normal distributions have these properties:

* Normal distributions are symmetric about the mean.\tightlist
* No upper limit or lower limit exists, in theory, for the variable.
  Of course, the chance that some of these values occur is essentially zero (such as a male taller than 350cm).
* The [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule) applies:

  * approximately 68% of values lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean;
  * approximately 95% of values lie within 2 standard deviations  of the mean; and
  * approximately 99.7% of values lie within 3 standard deviations  of the mean.

These properties are true for *all* normal distributions, whatever the mean $\mu$ and whatever the standard deviation $\sigma$.




## Standardising ($z$-scores) {#z-scores}

<!-- Since many statistics have a normal distribution (under certain circumstances), the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule) can be used to understand the distribution of sample statistics. -->
Since the 68--95--99.7 rule (Sect. \@ref(def:EmpiricalRule)) applies for all normal distributions, the percentages only depend on how many standard deviations ($\sigma$) a value ($x$) is from the mean ($\mu$).
This information can be used to learn more about how values are distributed.


::: {.example #HeightsExer1 name="The 68--95--99.7 rule"}
Suppose heights of Australian adult males have a mean of $\mu = 175$cm, and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 7$cm, and (approximately) follow a normal distribution.
Using this model, what proportion of Australian adult men are *taller* than 182cm?
:::

From a picture of the situation (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer1), left panel), $175 + 7 = 182$cm is one standard deviation *above* the mean.
Since 68% of values are within one standard deviation of the mean, 32% are outside that range, smaller or larger.
Hence, 16% are taller than one standard deviation above the mean, so the answer is about 16%.
(Another 16% are less than one standard deviation *below* the mean, or less than $175 - 7 = 168$cm in height.)

Again, the percentages only depend on how many standard deviations ($\sigma$) the value ($x$) is from the mean ($\mu$), and not the actual values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$.

::: {.example #HeightsExer2 name="The 68--95--99.7 rule"}
Consider again the heights of Australian adult males.
Using this model, what proportion are *shorter* than 161cm?

Again, drawing the situation is helpful (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer1), right panel).
Since $175 - (2\times 7) = 161$, then 161cm is two standard deviation *below* the mean.
Since 95% of values are within two standard deviation of the mean, 5% are outside that range (half smaller, half larger; see Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer1), right panel), so that 2.5% are *shorter* than 161cm.
(Another 2.5% are *taller* than $175 + 14 = 189$cm.)
:::




Again, the percentages only depend on how many standard deviations ($\sigma$) the value ($x$) is from the mean ($\mu$).
The number of standard deviations that an observation is from the mean is called a *$z$-score*.
A $z$-score is computed using

\[
   z = \frac{ x - \mu}{\sigma},
\]
where $\sigma$ is a measure of the variation in the $x$-values.
Converting values to $z$-scores is called *standardising*.


::: {.definition #zScore name="z-score"}
A *$z$-score* measures how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.
In symbols:

\begin{equation}
   z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma},
   (\#eq:zscores)
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the value, $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution (measuring the variation in the $x$-values).
:::
 
The $z$-score is the *number of standard deviations the observation is away from the mean*, and is also called the *standardised value* or *standard score*, and is calculated using Equation \@ref(eq:zscores).
Note that:

* $z$-scores are negative for observations *below* the mean.
* $z$-scores are positive for observations *above* the mean.
* $z$-scores have no units (that is, not measured in kg, or cm, etc.).


 
::: {.example #HeightsExer3 name="$z$-scores"}
In Example \@ref(exm:HeightsExer1), the $z$-score for a height of 182cm is 

\[
   z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{182 - 175}{7} = 1,
\]
one standard deviation *above* the mean.
In Example \@ref(exm:HeightsExer2), the $z$-score for a height of 161cm is

\[
   z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{161 - 175}{7} = -2,
\]
two standard deviations *below* the mean (a *negative* $z$-score means the value is *below* the mean).

Consider the model for the heights of Australian adult males: a normal distribution, mean $\mu = 175$, standard deviation $\sigma = 7$ (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:HeightsModel)).

Using this model:

* A height of 175cm is zero standard deviations from the mean: $z = 0$.
* 168cm is one standard deviation *below* the mean: $z = -1$.
* 182cm is one standard deviation *above* the mean: $z = 1$.
* 161cm and 189cm are two standard deviations from the mean: $z = -2$ and $z = 2$ respectively.

## Approximating percentages using the 68--95--99.7 rule {#ApproxProbs}


As we have seen above, percentages under normal distributions can be *approximated* using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule).


::: {.example #Height160 name="Normal distribution areas"}
Suppose again that heights of Australian adult males have a mean of $\mu = 175$cm, and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 7$cm, and (approximately) follow a normal distribution (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:HtsEmpirical)).

To find the proportion of men *shorter* than 160cm, first draw the situation (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer3)).

Proceeding as before, we ask 'How many standard deviations below the mean is 160cm?'
Using Equation \@ref(eq:zscores) to compute the $z$-score, $160$cm corresponds to a $z$-score of 

\begin{equation}
   z = \frac{160 - 175}{7} = -2.14;
   (\#eq:zscore214)
\end{equation}
that is, $2.14$ standard deviations *below* the mean.

What percentage of observations are less than this $z$-score?
This case is not covered by the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule), though we can use the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule) to make some *rough estimates*.

About 2.5% of observations are less than 2 standard deviations below the mean (Example \@ref(exm:HeightsExer1)); that is, about 2.5% of men are shorter than 161cm.
So the percentages males even shorter than 161cm (that is, further into the tail of the distribution), will be *less* than 2.5%.
While we don't know the probability exactly, it will be smaller than 2.5%.

Estimates in this way are crude, but often serviceable.
However, better estimates of 'areas under the normal curve' are found using tables compiled for this very purpose.
These tables are in 
`r if ( knitr::is_html_output()) { 
   'Appendix \\@ref(ZTablesOnline).'
} else {
   'Appendices \\@ref(ZTablesNEG) and \\@ref(ZTablesPOS).'
   }`
'Percentages' under a normal curve are also called 'areas' under the normal curve.
The *total area* under a normal curve is one (or 100%), since it represent all possible values that could be observed: evety height appear somewhere in Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsEmpirical).

We now learn how to use these tables for Example \@ref(exm:Height160).


## Exact areas from normal distributions {#ExactAreasUsingTables}

Areas under normal distributions can be found using *online* tables, or *hard copy* tables.
The online tables are easier to use,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'but only the *hard-copy* tables are explained in this book (see the [online](https://bookdown.org/pkaldunn/SRM-Textbook/tables.html#ZTablesOnline) version of this book for how to use the online tables).'
} else {
   'but only the *online* tables are explained in this online book (see the hard-copy version for how to use the hard-copy tables).'
}`

```{r, child = if (knitr::is_latex_output()) './Tables/Ztables-Using-Hardcopy.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = if (knitr::is_html_output()) './Tables/Ztables-Using-Online.Rmd'}
```

The hard-copy or online tables gives an answer of $1.62$%.
This agrees with the approximate answer using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule): less than $2.5$%.


## Computing areas (probabilities)

The general approach to computing probabilities from normal distributions is:

* *Draw a diagram*, and mark on 160cm (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer3)).
* *Shade* the required region of interest: 'less than 160cm tall' (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer3)).
* *Compute* the $z$-score using Equation \@ref(eq:zscores).
* *Use* the $z$ tables in `r if ( knitr::is_html_output()) { 'Appendix \\@ref(ZTablesOnline).'} else {'Appendices \\@ref(ZTablesNEG) and \\@ref(ZTablesPOS).'}`
* *Compute* the answer.

The number of standard deviations that 160cm is from the mean was computed above (Eq. \@ref(eq:zscore214)): $z = -2.14$.
That is, 160cm is $2.14$ standard deviations *below* the mean, so use $z = -2.14$ in the tables (remembering that the tables give probability (area) *less* than $z = -2.14$; Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer3)).

The probability of finding an Australian man less than 160cm tall is about $1.6$%.
The 68--95--99.7 rule can be used to give *approximate* probabilities, as a check that the answer found using tables seems reasonable.

More complicated questions can be asked too, as shown in the next section.

## Examples using $z$-scores {#Z-Score-Forestry}


::: {.example #NormalTrees name="Normal distributions"}
@data:Aedo1997:softwood simulated mechanized forest harvesting systems [@DevoreBerk2007].
In their study, they modelled the diameter of specific trees using

* a normal distribution; with
* a mean of $\mu = 8.8$ inches; and
* a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.7$ inches.

Using this model, what is the probability that a randomly-chosen tree has a diameter *greater than* than 6 inches?
:::


Follow the steps identified earlier:

* *Draw* a normal curve, and mark on 6 inches (Fig. \@ref(fig:ZDBH1), left panel).
* *Shade* the region corresponding to 'greater than 6 inches' (Fig. \@ref(fig:ZDBH1), right panel).
* *Compute* the $z$-score using Eq. \@ref(eq:zscores):
  $\displaystyle z = (6 - 8.8)/2.7 = -2.8/2.7 = -1.04$ to two decimal places.
* *Use* tables:
  The probability of a tree diameter *shorter* than 6 inches is $0.1492$. 
  (The tables always give area *less* than the value of $z$ that is looked up.)
* *Compute* the answer:
  Since the *total* area under the normal distribution is one, the probability of a tree diameter  *greater* than 6 inches is $1 - 0.1492 = 0.8508$, or about $85$%.

The normal-distribution tables **always** provide area to the **left** of the $z$-score looked up.
Drawing a picture of the situation is important: it helps visualise getting the answer from what the table give us.

::: {.example #NormalTrees2 name="Normal distributions"}
Using the model for tree diameters in Example \@ref(exm:NormalTrees), what is the probability that a tree has a diameter *between* 6 and 11 inches?
:::

First, **draw** the situation, and **shade** 'between 6 and 10 inches' (Fig. \@ref(fig:MatchDiagrams), Diagram C).
Then, **compute** the $z$-scores for *both* tree diameters:

* For 6 inches: $\quad  z = (6 - 8.8)/2.7 = -1.04$.
* For 11 inches: $\quad z = (11 - 8.8)/2.7 = 0.81$.

Table B can then be used to find the area to the *left* of $z = -1.04$, and also the area to the *left* of $z = 0.81$.
However, neither of these provide the area *between* $z = -1.04$ and $z = 0.81$ (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:ZDBH3)).


```{r ZDBH3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="What proportion of tree diameters are between 6 and 11 inches?

par( mfrow = c(1, 2))

out <- plotNormal(mu,
                  sigma,
                  cex.axis = 0.85,
                  main = expression(What~tables~give~"for"~italic(z)==-1.04),
                  xlab = "Tree diameters (inches)")

            col = plot.colour,
            lo = 0,
            hi = 11)


```


Looking carefully at the areas from the tables and the area sought, that area between the two $z$-scores is
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '$0.7910 - 0.1492 = 0.6418$ (the online version has an animation).'
} else {
   '$0.7910 - 0.1492 = 0.6418$; see the animation below.'

The probability that a tree has a diameter between 6 and 11 inches is about $0.6418$, or about $64$%.

## Unstandardising: Working backwards {#Unstandardising}

Using the model for tree diameters in Example \@ref(exm:NormalTrees) again, different types of questions can be asked too.

::: {.example #MNormalBackwards name="Normal distributions backwards"}
Consider again the trees study (Example \@ref(exm:NormalTrees)). 
Identify the diameters of the *smallest* 3% of trees.
:::


This is a different problem than before; previously, the *tree diameter* was known, so a $z$-score could be computed, and hence a probability (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:WorkingWithZ), top panel).

However, in Example \@ref(exm:MNormalBackwards), the *probability* is known, and a tree diameter is sought.
That is, working 'backwards' is needed (Fig. \@ref(fig:WorkingWithZ), bottom panel), so the $z$-tables need to be used 'backwards' too.

Drawing a rough diagram of the situation again is very helpful (Fig. \@ref(fig:DBHBackwards)).
We can only mark the approximate location of the required score, but this is sufficient.
Then, tables must be used to determine the necessary $z$-score.


```{r DBHBackwards, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Tree diameters: The smallest 3\\%. The approximate location of the required $z$-score is drawn.", fig.align="center", out.width='60%', fig.width=6.5, fig.height=3.0}

As before (Sect. \@ref(ExactAreasUsingTables)), *online* tables, or *hard copy* tables can be used (and again the online tables are easier to use).
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Only the *hard-copy* tables are explained in this book (see the online version for how to use the online tables).'
} else {
   'Only the *online* tables are explained in this online book (see the hard-copy version for how to use the hard-copy tables).'

```
```{r, child = if (knitr::is_html_output()) './Tables/Ztables-Using-Online-Tables-Backwards.Rmd'}
```


Using hard copy tables, the closest value in the *body* of the tables to $3$% (or $0.030$) is $0.0301$.
(Sometimes, the exact area can be found, but usually we take the value as close as possible.)
This corresponds to a $z$-score of $z = -1.88$.
Using the online tables (and entering an `Area.to.the.left` of $0.0300$), the $z$-score is $-1.881$ (a slightly more precise answer).


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
To identify the diameters of the *smallest* $3$% of trees, the $z$-score that has an area to the *left* of $3$% (or $0.030$) needs to be found (or, at least, as close as possible to $0.03$).
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The tables always give the area to the **left** of the $z$-score that is looked up.
:::


Using either the hard-copy or online tables, the appropriate $z$-value is $-1.88$ standard deviations *below* the mean; that is, $z = -1.88$ (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:DBHBackwards)).
The $z$-score can be converted to an observation value $x$ using the *unstandardising* formula^[This is found by re-arranging Equation&nbsp;\@ref(eq:zscores).]:  
\[
	x = \mu + z\sigma.
\]
Using this unstandardising formula:  
\begin{align*}
	x &= \mu + (z\times\sigma) \\
		&= 8.8 + (-1.88 \times 2.7) = 3.724;
\end{align*}
that is, about $3$% of trees have diameters less than about $3.72$ inches.


::: {.definition #UnstandardizingFormula name="Unstandardizing formula"}
When the $z$-score is known, the corresponding value of the observation $x$ is
\begin{equation}
	x = \mu + z\sigma.
(\#eq:UnstandardisingFormula)
\end{equation}
This is called the *unstandardising formula*.

::: {.example #LargestPC name="Normal distributions backwards"}
Using the model for tree diameters in Example \@ref(exm:NormalTrees) again, suppose now the diameters of the *largest* $25$% of trees needs to be identified.
What are these diameters?
:::


The tree diameters can be modelled with a normal distribution, with a mean of $\mu = 8.8$ inches and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.7$ inches.
Since an area is given, we need to work 'backwards' (Fig. \@ref(fig:DBHBackwards2), bottom panel), so the $z$-tables need to be used 'backwards' too.
The *largest* $25$% implies large trees, so diameter is larger than the mean. 

Using a diagram is important (Fig. \@ref(fig:DBHBackwards2)): the tables work with the area to the *left* of the value of interest, which is $75$%.
Using either the hard-copy or online tables, the appropriate $z$-value is $z = 0.674$.
Then, the $z$-score can be converted to an observation value $x$ using the [*unstandardising* formula](#def:UnstandardizingFormula):
\begin{align*}
	x &= \mu + (z\times\sigma) \\
		&= 8.8 + (0.674 \times 2.7) = 10.621.
\end{align*}
That is, about $25$% of trees have diameters larger than about $10.6$&nbsp;inches.

## Example: methane production

A study of methane produced by animals [@huhtanen2016effects] modelled the retention time of food in sheep using a normal distribution, with the mean retention time as $\mu = 42.5$ hours, and the standard deviation of the retention time as $\sigma = 3.68$ hours.
We can draw this normal distribution (Fig. \@ref(fig:RetentionTime)), and then apply the 68--95--99.7 rule:

* About 68% of retention times are between 38.83 and 46.18 hrs;
* About 95% of retention times are between 35.14 and 49.86 hrs;
* About 99.7% of retention times are between 31.46 and 53.54 hrs.



```{r RetentionTime, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Retention times of food in sheep", fig.align="center", fig.width=6.5, fig.height=2.75, out.width='60%'}

out <- plotNormal(42.5,
                  3.68,
                  xlab = "Retention times (in hours)",
                  main = "Retention times of food in sheep",
                  round.dec = 2)
```


::: {.example #Methane1 name="Working with the normal distribution"}
Using this model, what proportion of sheep have a retention time *less than* 40 hours?
:::

A retention time of 40 hours corresponds to a $z$-score of:  
\[
   z = \frac{40 - 42.5}{3.68} = -0.68.
\]
This is a *negative* number, since 40 hours is *below* the mean.
Using the normal distribution tables (that give the *area to the left* of the $z$-score), the area to the left of $z = -0.68$ is $0.2483$, or about $24.8$% (Fig \@ref(fig:RetentionPlots), top left panel).
About $24.8$% of sheep have a retention times *less* than 40 hours.


::: {.example #Methane2 name="Working with the normal distribution"}
What proportion of sheep have a retention time *greater than* 48 hours (two days)?
:::

A retention time of 48 hours corresponds to a $z$-score of $1.49$.

A retention time of 40 hours corresponds to $z = -0.68$, and, using the normal distribution tables, the area to the *left* of $z = -0.68$ is $0.2483$ (Fig. \@ref(fig:RetentionPlots), bottom left panel; hatched area).
But this is not the area that we are seeking...
From earlier, the area to the *left* of $z = 1.49$ is $0.9319$ (Fig. \@ref(fig:RetentionPlots), bottom left panel; coloured region).
But this is not the area to that we are seeking either...

From the two areas that we know, we *can* find the area that we are seeking:

* 48 hours corresponds to $z = 1.49$. The area to the *left* of this $z$-score is $0.9319$.
* 40 hours corresponds to $z = -0.68$. The area to the *left* of this $z$-score is $0.2483$.
* The *difference* between these two *areas* is what we are seeking: $0.9319 - 0.2483 = 0.6836$.

So the proportion is about $0.684$ (or $68.4$%).


::: {.example #Methane4 name="Working with the normal distribution"}
Consider the 35% of sheep with the *shortest* retention times.
What are these retention times?
:::

The time we seek must be *smaller* than the mean if it defines the *shortest* 35% of retention times.
We don't know *exactly* where to draw the retention time that this corresponds to on the diagram; it's just somewhere to the left of the mean (Fig \@ref(fig:RetentionPlots), bottom right panel).

This time, *we know the area to the left*, but we do not know the value (or $z$-score).
Previously, we knew the retention value (and hence the $z$-score), but not the area.
This is like a 'backwards problem', and we need to find the $z$-score 'backwards' (Sect. \@ref(Unstandardising)).
From the hard copy tables, a $z$-score of $z = -0.39$ has an area to the left of $0.3483$... which is as close as we can get.
From the online tables, $z = -0.385$.

We know the $z$-score, so we can find the retention value, using the unstandardising formula: $x = \mu + (z \times \sigma)$.
The retention time is $41.07$ hours.



## Summary {#Chap17-Summary}

A **model** is a way of theoretically describing the distribution of some quantitative variable in a population.
One common model is a **normal model** or **normal distribution**, which is a bell-shaped distribution with a theoretical mean $\mu$ and a theoretical standard deviation $\sigma$.
Probabilities can be computed from normal distributions using **$z$-scores**.

::: {.exercise #SamplingDistributionsTrees}
Consider again the study by @data:Aedo1997:softwood, who studied the diameter of trees in certain forests.
The tree diameters can be modelled as having a normal distribution, with a mean of $\mu = 8.8$ inches, and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.7$ inches.
For these trees:

1. What is the probability that a tree will have a diameter *less than* 8 inches?
1. What is the probability that a tree will have a diameter *greater than* 9 inches?
1. What is the probability that a tree will have a diameter *between* 7 and 10 inches?
1. The largest 15% of trees have what diameters?
1. The smallest 25% of trees have what diameters?

::: {.exercise #SamplingDistributionsGestationLength}
In a study [@snowden2018causal] to understand factors influencing preterm births, the gestation length of healthy babies was modelled with a normal distribution, having a mean of 40 weeks, and a standard deviation of 1.64 weeks.
Using this model:

1. What proportion of births are *longer* than 39 weeks (that is, nine months)?
1. In Australia, 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'a premature birth is defined as a birth occuring before 37 weeks.'
} else {
   '[a premature birth is defined as a birth occuring before 37 weeks](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/premature-baby).'
}`
   What proportion of births are expected to be premature?
1. According to
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Health Direct,'
} else {
   '[Health Direct](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/premature-baby),'
}`
   'Babies born between 32 and 37 weeks may need care in a special care nursery'.
   What proportion of healthy births would be expected to be born between 32 and 37 weeks gestation? 
1. How long is the gestation length for the *longest* 5% of pregnancies?
1. How long is the gestation length for the *shortest* 5% of pregnancies?

::: {.exercise #SamplingDistributionsChargingEVs}
A study of the impact of charging electric vehicles (EVs) on electricity demands [@affonso2018probabilistic] modelled the *time* at which people began charging their EVs at home.
Based on a survey [@us20112009], they modelled the time at which EVs began charging as having a mean of 5:30pm, with a standard deviation of 2.28 hrs.
For this model:

1. What is the probability that an EVs will begin charging after 9pm?
1. What is the probability that an EVs will begin charging before 5pm?
1. What is the probability that an EVs will begin charging between 5pm and 6pm?
1. 30% of the EVs begin charging after what time?
1. The earliest 15% of charging begins when?
  
**Hint:** This question is *much* easier if you convert times into 'minutes after midnight'.
