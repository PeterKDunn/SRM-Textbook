## Introduction {#Chap17-Intro}

In the [decision-making process used in statistics](#DecisionMaking), an **assumption** is made about the population parameter, and then, based on this assumption, the values **expected** from the sample statistics can be described.

The **expectations** about the sample statistic are based around how the statistic (such as a sample mean, or a sample proportion, or a sample odds ratio) is [*distributed*](#GraphsOneQuant): what values it can take in various samples, and how often.

A *model* is used to describe this *sampling* [*distribution*](#GraphsOneQuant).
For example, if I deal 15 cards, the *statistic* could be 'the proportion of red cards in a hand of 15'.
The *model* would describe how often we would see 0 red cards in 15, 1 red card in 15, 2 red cards in 15, ... up to 15 red cards in 15
(Sect. \@ref(MakingDecisionsInResearch)).

Under [certain circumstances](#ValidityProportions), many different statistics have a similarly-shaped distribution: a [*bell-shaped (or normal) distribution*](#NormalDistributions).
We now study this distribution, as it often is the basis for describing what values the statistic can be **expected** to take, based on the **assumption** about the population that we begin with.



## Distributions: An example

To begin, consider the heights of *all* Australian adult males.
Clearly, the height of *all* Australian adult males is unknown: no-one has ever, or could ever realistically, measure the height of all Australian adult males.
The
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS),'
} else {
   '[Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4338.0main+features212011-13),'
}`
however, takes samples of Australians to compute estimates of the heights and other measurements.

A model could be **assumed** for the heights of all Australian adult males.
This is a *theoretical* idea that might be a useful description of the heights of Australian adult males in the *population*.
Suppose a *model* for the heights of Australian adult males is adopted that has:

* a symmetric distribution,
* with a *mean height* of 175 cm, and 
* a *standard deviation* of 7 cm. 

Then, the *distribution* of the heights of Australian adult males would look like Fig. \@ref(fig:HeightsModel).
That is, most Australian adult males are between about 168 and 182cm, and very few are taller than 196cm or shorter than 154cm.

```{r HeightsModel, echo=FALSE, results='hide', fig.cap="A model for the heights of Australian adult males", fig.align="center", fig.width=5, fig.height=2.5}
HT.mn <- 175
HT.sd <- 7

plot.norm(HT.mn, HT.sd, 
          xlab.name = "Height (in cm)", 
          zlim.lo = -4, 
	  zlim.hi = 4, 
          type = "",
          shade.lo.x = -5, 
	  shade.hi.x = 5 )
```

This model represents an idealised, or *assumed*, picture of the histogram of the heights of all Australian adult males in the *population*.
If this model is a accurate, the distribution of heights in any *sample*, may be shaped a bit like this... but *sampling variation* will exist.

Any one sample will look a bit different than this model, but this model captures the general feel of the histogram from many of these samples.
For example,
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Fig. \\@ref(fig:HeightsModelFig) shows a histogram from *one* sample of$n=100$ men (the online version has an animation), but every sample will be different.'
} else {
   'see the animation below, where many samples of $n=100$ men are taken.'
}`

The model of heights has approximately a bell-shape: that is, most values are near the average height, but a small number of men are very tall or very short.
A bell-shaped distribution is formally called a **normal distribution** or a **normal model**.
A normal distribution is a way of *modelling* the population.
			
A *model* is a theoretical or ideal concept.
In the same way that a model skeleton isn't 100% accurate (wire joins?) and certainly not exactly like *your* skeleton, it suitably approximates reality.
None of us probably have a skeleton *exactly* like the model, but the model is still useful and helpful.

Likewise, no variable has *exactly* a normal distribution, but the model is still useful and helpful.
The model is a *theoretical* way of describing the distribution in the population.


## Normal distributions {#NormalDistribution}

A suitable model for the heights of *all* Australian adult males may be described (Fig. \@ref(fig:HeightsModel)) as having:

* An approximately normal shape,
* With a mean height of $\mu = 175$ cm, and 
* A standard deviation of $\sigma = 7$ cm. 

This model for the heights of Australian adult males is a *theoretical idea* about the unknown *population*: it does not represent any particular sample of data.
The model can be thought of as an 'average' of the histograms of the data from many samples.

Indeed, if this model turns out to be poor at describing what appears in these many samples, the [*parameters*](#StatisticsAndParameters) of the model (that is, the values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$) can be adjusted so the model *does* describe the sample data well.

In fact, sample evidence suggests that the average height of Australians has been increasing [@loesch2000secular] and so the mean of the model may need to be changed at various times to  remain a good model for heights of Australian adult males.



## Standardising ($z$-scores) {#z-scores}

Since many statistics have a normal distribution (under certain circumstances), the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule) can be used to understand the distribution of sample statistics.

Recall that the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule) states that, for *any* normal distribution (Fig. \@ref(fig:HusbandHistNormalShadeEmpirical)):

* 68% of values lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean;
* 95% of values lie within 2 standard deviations  of the mean; and
* 99.7% of values lie within 3 standard deviations  of the mean.

These percentages only depend on how many standard deviations ($\sigma$) a value ($x$) is from the mean ($\mu$).
This information can be used to learn about how values are distributed.

::: {.example #HeightsExer1 name="The 68--95--99.7 rule"}
Suppose heights of Australian adult males have a mean of $\mu = 175$cm, and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 7$cm, and (approximately) follow a normal distribution.
Using this model, what proportion of Australian adult men are *taller* than 182cm?
  
Drawing the situation is helpful (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer1)).
Notice that $175 + 7 = 182$cm is one standard deviation *above* the mean.
We know that 68% of values are within one standard deviation of the mean, so that 32% are outside that range (smaller or larger) (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer1)).
Hence, 16% are taller than one standard deviation above the mean, so the answer is about 16%.
(Another 16% are less than one standard deviation *below* the mean, or less than $175 - 7 = 168$cm in height.)

Again, the percentages only depend on how many standard deviations ($\sigma$) the value ($x$) is from the mean ($\mu$), and not the actual values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$.

Again, drawing the situation is helpful (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer2)).

Since $175 - (2\times 7) = 161$, then 161cm is two standard deviation *below* the mean.
Since 95% of values are within two standard deviation of the mean, 5% are outside that range (half smaller, half larger; see Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer2)), so that 2.5% are *shorter* than 161cm.

Again, the percentages only depend on how many standard deviations ($\sigma$) the value ($x$) is from the mean ($\mu$).
The number of standard deviations that an observation is from the mean is called a *$z$-score*.

A $z$-score is computed using

\[
   z = \frac{ x - \mu}{\sigma}.
\]
Converting values to $z$-scores is called *standardising*.


::: {.definition #zScore name="z-score"}
A *$z$-score* measures how many standard deviations a value is from the mean.
In symbols:

\begin{equation}
   z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma},
   (\#eq:zscores)
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the value, $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution.
:::
 
 
::: {.example #HeightsExer3 name="z-scores"}
In Example \@ref(exm:HeightsExer1), the $z$-score for a height of 182cm is 

\[
   z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{182 - 175}{7} = 1,
\]
one standard deviation *above* the mean.

In Example \@ref(exm:HeightsExer2), the $z$-score for a height of 161cm is

\[
   z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{161 - 175}{7} = -2,
\]
two standard deviations *below* the mean (a *negative* $z$-score means the value is *below* the mean).
:::


The $z$-score is the *number of standard deviations the observation is away from the mean*.
The $z$-score is also called the *standardised value* or *standard score*, and is calculated using Equation \@ref(eq:zscores).
Note that:

* $z$-scores are negative for observations *below* the mean, and positive for observations *above* the mean.
* $z$-scores are numbers without units (that is, it is not in kg, or cm, etc.).

* 168cm and 182cm are one standard deviation from the mean: $z = -1$ and $z = 1$ respectively.
* 161cm and 189cm are two standard deviations from the mean: $z = -2$ and $z = 2$ respectively.

## Approximating areas using the 68--95--99.7 rule

     y = 0.15,

     labels = "160 cm")
```


Proceeding as before, we ask 'How many standard deviation below the mean is 160cm?'
Using Equation \@ref(eq:zscores) to compute the $z$-score, $160$cm corresponds to a $z$-score of 

\[
   z = \frac{160 - 175}{7} = -2.14;
\]
that is, $2.14$ standard deviations *below* the mean.

What percentage of observations are less than this $z$-score?
This case is not covered by the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule), though we can use the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule) to make some *rough estimates*.

About 2.5% of observations are less than 2 standard deviations below the mean (Example \@ref(exm:HeightsExer1)); that is, about 2.5% of men are shorter than 161cm.

So the percentages males even shorter than 161cm (that is, further into the tail of the distribution), will be *less* than 2.5%.
While we don't know the probability exactly, it will be smaller than 2.5%.

Estimates in this way are crude, but often serviceable.
However, better estimates of 'areas under the normal curve' are found using tables compiled for this very purpose.

These tables are in `r if ( knitr::is_html_output()) { 'Appendix \\@ref(ZTablesOnline).'} else {'Appendices \\@ref(ZTablesNEG) and \\@ref(ZTablesPOS).'}`
'Percentages' under a normal curve are also called 'areas' under the normal curve.
The *total area* under a normal curve is one (or 100%), since it represent all possible values that could be observed.

We now learn how to use these tables, then come back to Example \@ref(exm:Height160).


## Exact areas from normal distributions

Areas under normal distributions can be found using:

* [**online** tables](#UsingOnlineZTables), or 
* [**hard copy** tables](#UsingZTables).

The online tables are easier to use.


### Using the online tables {#UsingOnlineZTables}

The online tables (which work differently to the [hard-copy tables](#UsingZTables)) can be found
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()){
   'in Appendix \\@ref(ZTablesOnline).'
} else {
   '[online](https://bookdown.org/pkaldunn/SRM-Textbook/tables.html#ZTablesOnline).'
}`
Consider the same example again: the percentage of observations *smaller than* $z = -2$.

The online tables `r if (knitr::is_html_output()){'(Appendix \\@ref(ZTablesOnline))'}` work with two decimal places, so consider the $z$-score as $z = -2.00$.

In the tables, enter the value `-2.00` in the search region just under the column labelled `z.score` (see the animation below).
After pressing `Enter`, the answer is shown in the column headed `Area.to.left`: the probability of finding a $z$-score less than $-2$ is 0.0228, or about 2.28\%.


<div style="text-align:center;">

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$video(src ="./Movies/HaveZFindArea.m4v", 
                      width = "500", 
                      controls = "controls", 
                      loop = "loop", 
                      style = "padding:2px;border-top:1px gray;border-bottom:1px gray;")
```
</div>

Using either the hard-copy or online tables gives an answer of about 2.28%.
Using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule), the answer we obtained was $2.5$%.
Recall that the 68--95--99.7 rule is an *approximation* only.


### Using the hard-copy tables {#UsingZTables}




:::::: {.cols data-latex=""}

::: {.col data-latex="{0.70\textwidth}"}


To demonstration the use of the normal distribution tables, consider the percentage of observations *smaller than* $z = -2$  (that is, two standard deviations *below* the mean) in a normal distribution.

Like the [online tables](#UsingZTables), the hard-copy tables `r if (knitr::is_latex_output()){'(Appendices \\@ref(ZTablesPOS) and \\@ref(ZTablesPOS))'}` work with $z$-scores to two decimal places, so consider the $z$-score as $z = -2.00$.

On the tables, find $-2.0$ in the left margin of the table, and find the second decimal place (in this case, 0) in the top margin of the table (Fig. \@ref(fig:TablesExampleLaTeX)): where these intersect is the area (or probability) *less than* the $z$-score.
So the probability of finding a $z$-score less than $z = -2$ is 0.0228, or about 2.28\%.
(The online tables work differently.)

## Comparing exact and approximate areas

Armed with knowledge of obtaining exact areas, let's return to Example \@ref(exm:Height160):


::: {.example #NornmalDistribution name="Using normal distributions"}
Suppose heights of Australian adult males have a mean of $\mu = 175$cm, and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 7$cm, and (approximately) follow a normal distribution.
Using this model, what proportion are *shorter* than 160cm?
:::


The general approach to computing probabilities from normal distributions is:

* **Draw a diagram**, mark on 160&nbsp;cm (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer3)).
* **Shade** the required region of interest: 'less than 160&nbsp;cm tall' (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:HtsExer3)).
* **Compute** the $z$-score using Equation \@ref(eq:zscores).
* **Use** the $z$ tables in `r if ( knitr::is_html_output()) { 'Appendix \\@ref(ZTablesOnline).'} else {'Appendices \\@ref(ZTablesNEG) and \\@ref(ZTablesPOS).'}`
* **Compute** the answer.

The number of standard deviations that 160cm is from the mean is found using Equation \@ref(eq:zscores):

\[  
   z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
     = \frac{160 - 175}{7}
     = \frac{-15}{7} 
     = -2.14.
\]
That is, 160cm is 2.14 standard deviations *below* the mean, so use $z = -2.14$ in the tables.
The diagram at the top of the tables reminds us that this is the probability (area) that the value of $z$ is *less* than $z = -2.14$ (Fig. \@ref(fig:HtsExer3)).
The probability of finding an Australian man less than 160cm tall is about 1.6%.

More complicated questions can be asked too, as shown in the next section.

@data:Aedo1997:softwood simulated mechanized forest harvesting systems [@DevoreBerk2007].
In their study, they modelled the diameter of specific trees using

* a normal distribution; with
* a mean of $\mu = 8.8$ inches; and
* a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.7$ inches.

Using this model, what is the probability that a tree has a diameter *greater than*  than 6 inches?
:::


Follow the steps identified earlier:

* **Draw** a normal curve, and mark on 6 inches (Fig. \@ref(fig:ZDBH1), top panel).
* **Shade** the region corresponding to 'greater than 6 inches' (Fig. \@ref(fig:ZDBH1), bottom panel).
* **Compute** the $z$-score using Eq. \@ref(eq:zscores).
  Here, $x = 6$, $\mu = 8.8$, $\sigma = 2.7$, so   $\displaystyle z = (6 - 8.8)/2.7 = -2.8/2.7 = -1.04$ to two decimal places.
* **Use** tables:
  The probability of a tree diameter *shorter* than 6 inches is $0.1492$. 
  (The tables always give area *less* than the value of $z$ that is looked up.)
* **Compute** the answer:
  Since the *total* area under the normal distribution is one, the probability of a tree diameter  *greater* than 6 inches is $1 - 0.1492 = 0.8508$, or about 85%.

::: {.example #NormalTrees2 name="Normal distributions"}
Using the model for tree diameters in Example \@ref(exm:NormalTrees) [@data:Aedo1997:softwood], what is the probability that a tree has a diameter *between* 6 and 11 inches?


First, **draw** the situation, and **shade** 'between 6 and 10 inches' (Fig. \@ref(fig:ZDBH2)).
Then, **compute** the $z$-scores for *both* tree diameters:

\begin{align*}
       \text{6 inches: }  &z = \displaystyle \frac{6 - 8.8}{2.7} = -1.04;\\[6pt]
       \text{11 inches: } &z = \displaystyle \frac{11 - 8.8}{2.7} = 0.81.
\end{align*}
Table B can then be used to find the area to the *left* of $z = -1.04$, and also the area to the *left* of $z = 0.81$.
However, neither of these provide the area *between* $z = -1.04$ and $z = 0.81$ (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:ZDBH3)).

Looking carefully at the areas from the tables and the area sought, that area between the two $z$-scores is
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {

} else {
   '$0.7910 - 0.1492 = 0.6418$; see the animation below.'

The probability that a tree has a diameter between 6 and 11 inches is about 0.6418, or about 64%.

## Unstandardising: Working backwards {#Unstandardising}

Using the model for tree diameters in Example \@ref(exm:NormalTrees) [@data:Aedo1997:softwood] again, suppose now the diameters of the *smallest* 10% of trees needs to be identified.
What are these diameters?

::: {.example #MNormalBackwards name="Normal distributions backwards"}
Consider again the trees study. 
The tree diameters can be modelled with

* a normal distribution; with
* a mean of $\mu = 8.8$ inches; and
* a standard deviation of $\sigma = 2.7$ inches.

Identify the diameters of the *smallest* 10% of trees.
:::


This is a different problem than before; previously, the *tree diameter* was known, so a $z$-score could be computed, and hence a probability (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:WorkingWithZ), top panel).

This time, the *probability* is known, and a tree diameter is sought.
That is, working 'backwards' is needed (Fig. \@ref(fig:WorkingWithZ), bottom panel), so the $z$-tables need to be used 'backwards' too.

### Using the hard-copy tables

When the $z$ scores (in the *margins* of the tables `r if (knitr::is_latex_output()){'(in Appendices \\@ref(ZTablesPOS) and \\@ref(ZTablesPOS))'}` were known, the *areas* were found in the *body* of the table.
If the area (or probability) is known (found in the body of the table), the corresponding $z$-score can be found (in the *margins* of the table), and hence the observation $x$; see the animation below.
The closest area to 10% in the tables is 0.1003, or 10.03%.

<div style="text-align:center;">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$video(src = "./Movies/HaveAreaFindZHardcopy.m4v", 
                      width = "700", 
                      controls = "controls", 
                      loop = "loop", 
                      style = "padding:2px;border-top:1px gray;border-bottom:1px gray;")
```
</div>


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
To identify the diameters of the smallest 10% of trees, the $z$-score that has an area to the left of 10% (or 0.10) needs to be found (at least, as close as possible to 0.10).

:::



### Using the online tables

When the area (or probability) is known, special online tables can be used `r if (knitr::is_html_output()){'(Appendix \\@ref(ZTablesOnlineBackwards))'}`. 
In these tables, enter the area to the left in search box under `Area.to.left`, and the corresponding $z$-scores appears under the `z.score` column 
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()){'(see the animation below).'} else {'.'}`


<div style="text-align:center;">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$video(src = "./Movies/HaveAreaFindZ.m4v", 
                      width = "500", 
                      controls = "controls", 
                      loop = "loop", 
                      style = "padding:2px;border-top:1px gray;border-bottom:1px gray;")
                      
                      
```
</div>


Using either the hard-copy or online tables, the appropriate $z$-value is $1.28$ standard deviations *below* the mean (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:DBHBackwards)).
Then, the $z$-score can be converted to an observation value $x$ using the *unstandardising* formula^[This is found by re-arranging Equation&nbsp;\@ref(eq:zscores).]:

\[
	x = \mu + z\sigma.
\]
Using this unstandardising formula:

\begin{align*}
	x &= \mu + (z\times\sigma) \\
		&= 8.8 + (-1.28 \times 2.7) = 5.344;
\end{align*}
that is,
about 10% of trees have diameters less than about 5.3&nbsp;inches.

::: {.example #LargestPC name="Normal distributions backwards"}
Using the model for tree diameters in Example \@ref(exm:NormalTrees) [@data:Aedo1997:softwood] again, suppose now the diameters of the *largest* 25% of trees needs to be identified.
What are these diameters?

The tree diameters can be modelled with

* a normal distribution; with
* a mean of $\mu = 8.8$ inches; and
* a standard deviation of $\sigma=2.7$ inches.

Again, we need to work 'backwards' (Fig. \@ref(fig:DBHBackwards2), bottom panel), so the $z$-tables need to be used 'backwards' too.
The *largest* 25% implies large trees, so we would expect a diameter larger than the mean. 

Using a diagram is important (Fig. \@ref(fig:DBHBackwards2)): the tables work with the area to the *left* of the value of interest, which is 75%.

Using either the hard-copy or online tables, the appropriate $z$-value is $z = 0.674$.
Then, the $z$-score can be converted to an observation value $x$ using the [*unstandardising* formula](#def:UnstandardizingFormula):

\begin{align*}
	x &= \mu + (z\times\sigma) \\
		&= 8.8 + (0.674 \times 2.7) = 10.621.

## Example: Methane production

A study @huhtanen2016effects of methane produced by animals modelled the retention time of food in sheep using a normal distribution, where the modelled used:

* the mean retention time as $\mu = 42.5$ hours, and
* the standard deviation of the retention time as $\sigma = 3.68$ hours.

We can draw this normal distribution (Fig. \@ref(fig:RetentionTime)), and then apply the 68--95--99.7 rule:

* About 68% of retention times are between 38.83 and 46.18 hrs;
* About 95% of retention times are between 35.14 and 49.86 hrs;
* About 99.7% of retention times are between 31.46 and 53.54 hrs.


::: {.example #Methane1 name="Working with the normal distribution"}
Using this model, what proportion of sheep have a retention time *less than* 40 hours?
:::

A retention time of 40 hours corresponds to a $z$-score of:

\[
   z = \frac{40 - 42.5}{3.68} = -0.68.
\]
This is a *negative* number, since 40 hours is *below* the mean.

We can then use the [normal distribution tables](#ZTablesOnline) that give us the **area to the left** of the $z$-score that we look up.
The area to the left of $z = -0.68$ is 0.2483, or about 24.8%: about 24.8% of sheep have a retention times less than 40 hours.


::: {.example #Methane2 name="Working with the normal distribution"}
What proportion of sheep have a retention time **greater than** 48 hours (two days)?
:::

A retention time of 48 hours corresponds to a $z$-score of $1.49$.
Using the normal distribution tables, the area to the **left** of this $z$-score is $0.9319$, so the area to the **right** of this $z$-score is $0.0681$.


::: {.example #Methane3 name="Working with the normal distribution"}
What proportion of sheep have a retention time **between** 36 and 48 hours?
:::

* A retention time of 36 hours corresponds to $z = -1.77$, and, using the [normal distribution tables](#ZTablesOnline), the area to the left of $z = -1.77$ is $0.0384$.
But this is not the area that we are seeking...
From earlier, the area to the left of $z = 1.49$ is 0.9319.
But this is not the area to that we are seeking either...

From the two areas that we know, we *can* find the area that we are seeking:

* 48 hours corresponds to $z = 1.49$. The area to the **left** of this $z$-score is 0.9319.
* 36 hours corresponds to $z = -1.77$. The area to the **left** of this $z$-score is 0.0384.
* The **difference** between these two *areas* is what we are seeking: $0.9319 - 0.0384 = 0.8935$.

So the proportion is about 0.894 (or 89.4%).


::: {.example #Methane4 name="Working with the normal distribution"}
Consider the 35% of sheep with the **shortest** retention times.
What are these retention times?
:::

The time we seek must be *smaller* than the mean" if it cuts off the *shortest* 35% of retention times.
We don't know exactly where to draw the retention time that this corresponds to on the diagram; it's just somewhere to the left of the mean...

This time, *we know the area to the left*, but we do not know the value (or $z$-score).
Previously, we knew the retention value (and hence the $z$-score), but not the area.
This is like a 'backwards problem'.
We need to look up the area to the left in the body of the table, and hence determine the corresponding $z$-score.

From the tables, a $z$-score of $z = -0.39$ has an area to the left of 0.3483... which is as close as we can get.

We know the $z$-score, so we can find the retention value, using the unstandardising formula: $x = \mu + (z \times \sigma)$.
The retention time $41.07$.



```{r RetentionTime, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Retention times", fig.align="center", fig.width=6, fig.height=2.5, out.width='60%'}

## Summary {#Chap17-Summary}

A **model** is a way of theoretically describing the distribution of some quantitative variable in a population.
One common model is a **normal model** or **normal distribution**, which is a bell-shaped distribution with a theoretical mean $\mu$ and a theoretical standard deviation $\sigma$.
Probabilities can be computed from normal distributions using **$z$-scores**.


## Quick revision questions {#Chap17-QuickReview}

1. Consider again the model for tree diameters in Example \@ref(exm:NormalTrees) [@data:Aedo1997:softwood]: a normal distribution with $\mu = 8.8$ inches, and $\sigma = 2.7$ inches.


```{r echo=FALSE}
mean.tree <- 8.8
sd.tree <- 2.7

if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  set.seed(111111110) # So printed books have *same* question
} 
diam1 <- round(runif(1, 6, 11), 1)
z1 <- round2( (diam1 - mean.tree)/sd.tree, 2)
prob1 <- pnorm(z1)

diam2 <- round(runif(1, 5, 14), 1)
z2 <- round2( (diam2 - mean.tree)/sd.tree, 2)
prob2 <- pnorm(z2)
```

   a. A tree diameter of `r diam1` inches corresponds to a $z$-score (to two decimal places) of:  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	fitb(z1,
 		num = TRUE,
		tol = 0.01)}` 
   b. The probability that a tree has a diameter *less* than `r diam1` inches is (as a *decimal value*):  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	fitb( prob1,
		num = TRUE,
		tol = 0.01)}` 
   c. The probability that a tree has a diameter *greater* than `r diam1` inches is (as a *decimal value*):  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	fitb( 1 - prob1,
		num = TRUE,
		tol = 0.01)}` 
   d. A tree diameter of `r diam2` inches corresponds to a $z$-score (to two decimal places) of (as a *decimal value*):  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	fitb(z2,
 		num = TRUE,
		tol = 0.01)}` 
   e. The probability that a tree has a diameter *less* than `r diam2` inches is (as a *decimal value*):  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	fitb( prob2,
		num = TRUE,
		tol = 0.01)}`
   f. The probability that a tree has a diameter *greater* than `r diam2` inches is (as a *decimal value*):  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	fitb( 1 - prob2,
		num = TRUE,
		tol = 0.01)}`
2. In a simulation of methods to coat corn seeds (with fertilizer and crop protection chemicals, etc.), Pasha et al. (2016) modelled the seed diameter as having a normal distribution, with mean 7.5mm and standard deviation of 0.225mm.

   a. What is the probability that a seed has a diameter of more than 8mm?  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	longmcq( c(
	   "About 2.22",
	   answer = "About 1.3%",
	   "About 98.7%"))}`
   b. What is the probability that a seed has a diameter less than 7.1mm?  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	longmcq( c(
	   "About 96.3%",
	   answer = "About 3.8%",
	   "About -1.78"))}`
   c. What is the probability that a seed has a diameter between 7.5 and 8mm?  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	longmcq( c(
	   "About 0.89",
	   answer = "About 48.7%",
	   "About 2.22",
	   "About 50%",
	   "About 98.7%"))}`
   d. What is the diameter of the smallest 30% of seeds?  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	longmcq( c(
	   "Smaller than about 7.62mm",
	   "Larger than about 7.38mm",
	   "About -0.524",
	   answer = "Smaller than about 7.38mm"))}`
   e. What is the diameter of the largest 90% of the seeds?  
  `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	longmcq( c(
	   "Less than about 7.79mm",
	   "Larger than about 7.79mm",
	   "Less than about 7.21mm",
	   answer = "**Larger** than about 7.21mm",
	   "About -1.28"))}`
3. Are the following statements **true** or **false**?
   * The unstandardising formula can be used to compute probabilities.  
   `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	 mcq( c("True", answer = "False"))}`
   * About 68% of observations are within two standard deviations of the mean.  
   `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	 mcq( c("True", answer = "False"))}`
   * Positive $z$-scores correspond to values larger than the mean.  
   `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	 mcq( c(answer = "True", "False"))}`
   * A $z$-score tells us how many standard deviations a value is away from the mean.  
   `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	 mcq( c(answer = "True", "False"))}`
   * A $z$-score larger than 4 is impossible.  
   `r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
	 mcq( c("True", answer = "False"))}`
   * A $z$-score of zero is located at the mean value.

IQ scores are
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'designed to have'
} else {
   '[designed to have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification)'
}`
a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
Match the diagram in Fig. \@ref(fig:IQMatchDiagramsForwards) with the meaning.

1. The *largest* 25% of IQ scores.
2. The *smallest* 10% of IQ scores.
3. The *largest* 70% of IQ scores.
4. The *smallest* 60% of IQ scores.

::: {.exercise #SamplingDistributionsChargingEVs}
A study of the impact of charging electric vehicles (EVs) on electricity demands [@affonso2018probabilistic] modelled the *time* at which people began charging their EVs at home.
Based on a survey [@us20112009], they modelled the time at which EVs began charging as having a mean of 5:30pm, with a standard deviation of 2.28 hrs.
For this model:

1. What is the probability that an EVs will begin charging after 9pm?
1. What is the probability that an EVs will begin charging before 5pm?
1. What is the probability that an EVs will begin charging between 5pm and 6pm?
1. 30% of the EVs begin charging after what time?
1. The earliest 15% of charging begins when?
  
**Hint:** This question is *much* easier if you convert times into 'minutes after midnight'.
