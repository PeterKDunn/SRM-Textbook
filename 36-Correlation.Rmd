## Correlation coefficients {#CorrCoefficients}

Describing the *linear* relationship between two *quantitative* variables requires describing the form, direction and variation.
A *correlation coefficient* is a single number encapsulating all this information.
In the *population*, the unknown value of the correlation coefficient is denoted $\rho$ ('rho'); in the *sample* the value of the correlation coefficient is denoted $r$.
As usual, $r$ (the *statistic*) is an estimate of $\rho$ (the *parameter*), and the value of $r$ is likely to be different in every sample (that is, *sampling variation* exists).


:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}

The symbol $\rho$ is the Greek letter 'rho', pronounced 'row', as in 'row your boat'.

Here, the *Pearson* correlation coefficient is discussed, suitable for describing *linear* relationships between *quantitative* data^[Other types of correlation coefficients also exist, such as the *Spearman* correlation, which may be used for monotonic, non-linear relationships.].
Pearson correlation coefficients only apply if the form is approximately *linear* (so check with a scatterplot first).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The Pearson correlation coefficient only make sense if the relationship is approximately linear.
:::


The values of $\rho$ and $r$ are *always* between $-1$ and $+1$.
The *sign* indicates whether the relationship has a positive or negative linear association, and the *value* of the correlation coefficient describes the strength of the relationship:

* $r = 0$ means *no linear relationship* between the variables:
  Knowing how the value of $x$ changes tells us nothing about how the value of $y$ changes.
  The best prediction for *any* value of $x$ is the mean of $y$.
* $r = +1$ means a *perfect, positive* relationship:
  knowing the value of $x$ produces a perfect prediction of the value of $y$, and *larger* values of $y$ are associated with *larger* values of $x$ (in general).
* $r = -1$ means a *perfect, negative* relationship:
  knowing the value of $x$ produces a perfect prediction of the value of $y$, and *larger* values of $y$ are associated with *smaller* values of $x$ (in general).

Software is used to compute the value of $r$ (formulas exist, but are tedious to use).
For the red deer data (Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)), the relationship is approximately linear, and the jamovi output (Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerCorrelationjamovi)) and SPSS output (Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerCorrelationSPSS)) show that $r = -0.584$.
The *sign* of $r$ is negative, indicating a *negative* relationship: Higher ages are associated with lighter molars (in general).
The *value* of $r$ indicates that the strength of the relationship is, perhaps, "moderate".



```{r RedDeerCorrelationjamovi, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="jamovi correlation output for the red deer data", fig.align="center", out.width="45%"}

knitr::include_graphics("SPSS/RedDeer/RedDeer-Correlation.png")
```


## R-squared ($R^2$) {#R2}

The value of $r$ describes the strength and direction of the linear relationship, but knowing exactly what the value *means* is tricky.
Interpretation is easier using $R^2$, or 'R-squared': the square of the value of $r$.
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
   'The animation below shows some values of $R^2$.'
}`


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The value of $R^2$ is *never* negative.
It is usually multiplied by 100 and hence expressed as a percentage.
:::


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
Even though the value of $R^2$ is never negative, you need to be careful when using your calculator!
With most calculators, entering `-0.5^2` returns `-0.25`.
The calculator interprets your input as meaning `-(0.25^2)`.
\smallskip

You need to use brackets: enter `(-0.5)^2`, which will give the expected answer of `0.25`.

The value of $R^2$ is the reduction in the unexplained variation of $y$ because the value of $x$ is known.
When expressed as a percentage, $R^2$ is the percentage of the variation in $y$ explained by using the linear relationship, rather than just the mean value of $y$.


::: {.example #R2Deer name="Values of R-squared"}
For the red deer data (Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)), the value of $R^2$ is $R^2 = (-0.584)^2 = 0.341$, usually written as a percentage: 34.1%.
The value of $R^2$ is positive, even though the value of $r$ is negative.
:::


For the red deer data, $R^2$ means that about 34.1% of the variation in molar weights can be explained by variation in the age of the deer.
The rest of the variation in molar weights is due to extraneous variables, such as weight, diet, amount of exercise, genetics, etc.

## Hypothesis testing {#CorrelationTesting}

### Introduction {#CorTesting-Intro}


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/diana-parkhouse-Qf4eZXC3t2Y-unsplash.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


For the red deer data (Sect. \@ref(RedDeerData); Sect. \@ref(CorrCoefficients)), the population correlation coefficient between the weight of molars $y$ and age of the deer $x$ is unknown, and denoted by $\rho$.
The sample correlation coefficient is $r = `r round(cor(RD$Age, RD$Weight), 3)`$, but the value of $r$ varies across all possible samples (*sampling variation* exists).

The size of the sampling variation is measured with a *standard error*.
However, the sampling distribution of $r$ does not have a normal distribution^[For those interested: the value of $r$ only varies between $-1$ and $1$, so cannot have a normal distribution. A transformation of the sample correlation coefficient does have an approximate normal distribution and *standard error*.], so we will not discuss CIs for the correlation coefficient.


### Hypothesis testing details

As usual, questions can be asked about the relationship between the variables in the *population*, as measured by the unknown *population* correlation coefficient:

> Is the *population* correlation coefficient zero, or not?

In the context of the red deer data:

> In male red deer, is there a correlation between age and the weight of molars?

The RQ is about the population parameter $\rho$.
Clearly, the *sample* correlation coefficient $r$ is not zero, and the RQ is asking if sampling variation if the reason for this.
The null hypotheses is:

* $H_0$: $\rho = 0$.

The parameter is $\rho$, the population correlation coefficient.
This hypothesis is the 'no relationship' position, which proposes that the population correlation coefficient is zero, and the sample correlation coefficient is not zero due to sampling variation.
The alternative hypothesis is:

* $H_1$:  $\rho \ne 0$ \quad (*two-tailed* test, based on the RQ).

As usual, we *assume* that $\rho = 0$ (from $H_0$), then describe what values of $r$ could be *expected*, under that assumption, across all possible samples (sampling variation).
Then the *observed* value of $r$ is compared to the expected values to determine if the value of $r$ supports or contradicts the assumption.

Software is used to conduct the hypotheses test.
The output (Figs. \@ref(fig:RedDeerCorrelationjamovi) (jamovi) and \@ref(fig:RedDeerCorrelationSPSS) (SPSS)) contains the relevant $P$-value (twice in the SPSS output!).
The two-tailed $P$-value for the test (labelled `Sig.` by SPSS) is less than 0.001 (`0.000` in SPSS).
The $P$-value is zero *to three decimal places*, so *very strong evidence* exists to support $H_1$ (that the correlation in the population is not zero).
We write:

> The sample presents very strong evidence (two-tailed $P < 0.001$) of a correlation between molar weight and the age of the male red deer ($r = -0.584$; $n = 78$) in the population.

Notice the three features of writing conclusions again:
An *answer to the RQ*; evidence to support the conclusion ('two-tailed $P < 0.001$'; no test statistic is given in the output); and some *sample summary information* ('$r = -0.584$; $n = 78$').


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The evidence suggests that the correlation coefficient is not zero (in the population).
However, a *non-zero* correlation doesn't necessarily mean a *strong* correlation exists.
The correlation may be weak in the population (as estimated by the value of $r$), but evidence exists that the correlation is *not zero* in the *population*.
:::


### Statistical validity conditions {#ValidityCorrelation}

As usual, these results hold under [certain conditions to be met](#exm:StatisticalValidityAnalogy).
The conditions for which the test is statistically valid are:

1. The relationship is approximately linear.
1. The variation in the response variable is approximately constant for all values of the explanatory variable.
1. The sample size is at least 25.

The sample size of 25 is a rough figure here, and some books give other values.


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityDeer name="Statistical validity"}
For the red deer data, the scatterplot (Fig. \@ref(fig:RedDeerScatter)) shows that the relationship is approximately linear, and the variation in molar weights doesn't seem to be obviously getting larger or smaller for older deer, so correlations are sensible.
The sample size is also greater than 25.
The test in Sect. \@ref(CorrelationTesting) will be statistically valid.
:::


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityBiomass name="Statistical validity"}
A study [@data:ForestBiomass2017; @mypapers:dunnsmyth:glms] examined the foliage biomass of small-leaved lime trees.
A plot of the foliage biomass against diameter (Fig. \@ref(fig:LimeScatter)) shows that the relationship is non-linear.
In addition, the variation in foliage biomass *increases* for larger diameters (for values of $x$ near 10, the values of $y$ do not vary much at all, but for values of $x$ near 30, the values of $y$ vary greatly). 
Both of these issues mean that correlations are not appropriate.
A hypothesis test similar to that in Sect. \@ref(CorrelationTesting) is inappropriate.
:::


```{r LimeScatter, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Foliage biomass plotted against diameter for small-leaved lime trees", fig.align="center", fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}

::: {.example #CorTestDogs name="Phu Quoc ridgeback dogs"}
A study of Phu Quoc Ridgeback dogs (*Canis familiaris*) recorded many measurements of the dogs, including body length and body height [@quan2017relation].
The scatterplot (Fig. \@ref(fig:DogsScatter)) shows an approximate linear relationship.
Each sample of dogs could produce a different value for $r$.
In this example, it does not matter which variable is used as $x$ or $y$.

Since taller dogs might be expected to be longer, we may ask:

> For these dogs, are longer dogs also taller dogs, in general?
  
The hypotheses are:

\[
    H_0: \rho = 0\quad\text{and}\quad H_1: \rho > 0\quad \text{(i.e., one-tailed)}
\]
From software, $r = 0.837$ and the two-tailed is $P < 0.001$, based on $n = 30$ dogs.
We write:

> Very strong evidence exists that longer Phu Quoc ridgeback dogs are also taller ($r = 0.837$; one-tailed $P < 0.001$; $n = 30$).

Since (a) the sample size is larger than 25; (b) the relationship is approximately linear; *and* (c) the variation in heights do not seem to differ for different lengths, the test is statistically valid.

A study of $n = 30$ paramedicine students examined (among other things) the relationship between the amount of stress experienced (measured using the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) while performing drug-dose calculation, and length of work experience [@leblanc2005paramedic].
The hypotheses are:
\[
   H_0: \rho = 0\quad\text{and}\quad H_1: \rho \ne 0.
\]
The correlation coefficient is given as $r = 0.346$ and $P = 0.18$ (from software).
No scatterplot is provided, so the test is statistically valid only if the relationship is approximately linear, and if the variation in STAI scores does not change for different levels of work experience.
The sample size is larger than 25, however.
We write:

> No evidence exists ($r = 0.346$; two-tailed $P = 0.18$) that the length of work experience is associated with STAI stress levels when performing drug-dose calculations.

The removal efficiency $y$ (in %) may depend on the inlet temperature (in $^\circ$C; $x$).
The RQ is

> In treating biofiltation wastewater, is the removal efficiency associated with the inlet temperature?

The population parameter is $\rho$, the correlation between the removal efficiency and inlet temperature.
A scatterplot of $n = 32$ samples (Fig. \@ref(fig:CorrelationRemovalEfficiency)) suggests an approximately linear relationship [@chitwood2001treatment; @DevoreBerk2007].

The output (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencyjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencySPSS)) shows that the sample correlation coefficient is $r = 0.891$, and so $R^2 = (0.891)^2 = 79.4$%.
This means that about 79.4% of the variation in removal efficiency can be explained by knowing the inlet temperature.


```{r CorrelationRemovalEfficiency, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The relationship between removal efficiency and inlet temperature", fig.align="center", fig.width=5, fig.height=3.5}
RE <- read.csv("Data/Removal.csv")

plot(Removal ~ Temp, 
     data = RE,
     xlab = "Temperature (degrees C)",
     ylab = "Removal efficiency (%)",
     pch = 19,
     ylim = c(97.5, 99.0),
     xlim = c(5, 18),
     las = 1
     )
```

To test if a relationship exists in the population, write:

\[
   H_0: \rho = 0;\quad\text{and}\quad H_1: \rho \ne 0
\]
The alternative hypothesis is two-tailed (as implied by the RQ).
The software output (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencyjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:RemovalEfficiencySPSS)) shows that $P < 0.001$.
We conclude:

> The sample presents very strong evidence (two-tailed $P < 0.001$) that removal efficiency depends on the inlet temperature ($r = 0.891$; $n = 32$) in the population.

The relationship is approximately linear, there is no obvious non-constant variance, and the sample size is larger than 25, so the hypothesis test results will be statistically valid.

## Summary {#Chap34-Summary}

In this chapter, *correlation* was used to describe the *strength* and direction of *linear* relationships between two *quantitative* variables.

*Correlation coefficients* (denoted $r$ in the sample; $\rho$ in the population) are always between $-1$ and $+1$.
*Positive* values denote *positive* relationships between the two variables: as one values gets larger, the other tends to get larger too.
*Negative* values denote *negative* relationships between the two variables: as one values gets larger, the other tends to get *smaller*.
Values close to $-1$ or $+1$ are very strong relationships; values near zero shows very little linear relationship between the variables.
Hypothesis tests for $r$ can be conducted using software.

Sometimes, $R^2$ is used to describe the relationship: it indicates what percentage of the variation in the response variable can be explained by knowing the value of the explanatory variables.

## Quick review questions {#Chap34-QuickReview}

A study of Chinese paedatric patients [@wong2018correlation] studied the relationship between the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2~max~) for $n = 29$ patients.
The correlation coefficient is reported as $r = 0.457$, and the corresponding $P$-value as $P = 0.013$.

1. The $x$-variable is
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
   longmcq( c(
     answer = "6-minute walk distance",
     "Maximum oxygen uptake"
) )} else {"________________"}`

1. True or false: Since the $P$-value is small, the correlation must be quite strong.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
   torf(answer=FALSE)
} else {"________________"}`

1. The relationship is best described as
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
   longmcq( c(
      "Negative",
     answer = "Positive"
) )} else {"________________"}`

1. The value of $R^2$ (to one decimal place, expressed as a percentage) is:
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {fitb(answer = 20.9, num=TRUE, tol=0.1)} else {"________________"}`

1. For statistical validity, we need to *assume* that:
`r if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {longmcq( c(
  "The response variable has a normal distribution",
  "The explanatory variable has a normal distribution",
  "The sample size is larger than 25",
  answer = "A linear relationship exists between the variables"
) )} else {"________________"}`

- Question in Sect. \ref{thinkBox:EstimateR}: $r$ will be a positive number (since the scatterplot shows a positive linear relationship), and its value will be close to 1 as the relationship looks very strong.
- Question in Sect. \ref{thinkBox:MeaningOfR2}: $R^2 = (0.532)^2 = 0.283$: about 28.3% of the variation in systolic BP is due to age; extraneous variable (weight, gender, amount of exercise, genetics, etc.) explain the remaining 71.7% of the variation in SBP values.
- \textbf{Answers to \textit{Quick Revision} questions:}
**1.** 6-minute walk distance.
**2.** False.
**3.** Positive.
**4.** 20.9.
**5.** A linear relationship exists between the variables.
