## Introduction {#Chap9-Intro}

The type of study and the research design determine how the results of the study should be interpreted.
Ideally, a study would be perfectly externally and internally valid; in practice this is very difficult to achieve.
Practically *every* study has limitations.
The results of a study should be interpreted in light of these limitations.
Limitations are not necessarily *problems*.

Limitations generally can be discussed through three components:

* *Internal validity* (Sect. \@ref(IntroInternalValidity)):
  Discuss any limitations to internal validity due to the research design (such as identifying possible confounding variables).
  This is related to the *effectiveness* of the study within the sample (Sect. \@ref(InterpretStudyDesign)).
* *External validity* (Sect. \@ref(IntroExternalValidity)):
  Discuss how well the sample represents the intended population.
  This is related to the *generalisability* of the study to the intended population (Sect. \@ref(InterpretGeneralisability)).
* *Ecological validity*:
  Discuss how well the study methods, materials and context approximate the real situation of interest.
  This is related to the *practicality* of the results to real life (Sect. \@ref(InterpretApplicability)).

The type of study often introduces some of these limitations (Chap.\ \@ref(ResearchDesign)).
All these issues should be addressed when considering the study limitations.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Almost every study has limitations.
*Identifying* potential limitations, and *discussing the likely impact* they have on the interpretation of the study results, is important and ethical.
:::


Different types of research studies have limitations.
Experimental studies, in general, have higher internal validity than observational studies, since more of the research design in under the control of the researchers; for example, random allocation of treatments is possible to minimise confounding.


:::{.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Only well-conducted experimental studies can show cause-and-effect relationships.
:::


However, experimental studies may suffer from poor *ecological* validity; for instance, laboratory experiments are often conducted under controlled temperature and humidity.
Many experiments also require that people be told about being in a study (due to ethics), and so internal validity may be comprised (the Hawthorne effect).


:::{.example name="Retrofitting"}
@giandomenico2022systematic studied retro-fitting houses with energy-saving devices, and found large discrepancies in savings for observational studies ($12.2$%) and experimental studies ($6.2$%).
The authors say that 'this finding reinforces the importance of using study designs with high internal validity to evaluate program savings' (p.\ 692).

## Limitations related to internal validity {#InterpretStudyDesign}
\index{Limitations!research design (effectiveness)}

Internal validity refers to the extent to which a cause-and-effect relationship can be established in a study, eliminating other possible explanations (Sect. \@ref(IntroInternalValidity)); that is, the *effectiveness* of the study using the sample. 
A discussion of the limitations of internal validity should cover, as appropriate: possible confounding and lurking variables variables; the impact of the Hawthorne, observer, placebo and carry-over effects; the impact of any other design decisions.

If any of these issues are likely to compromise internal validity, the implications on the interpretation of the results should be discussed.
For example, if the participants were not blinded, this should be clearly stated, and the conclusion should indicate that the individuals in the study may have behaved differently than usual.

::: {.example #LimitationsSeeds name="Study limitations"}
@axmann2020access randomly allocated Ugandan farmers to receive, or not receive, hybrid maize seeds.
One potential threat to internal validity was that farmers receiving the hybrid seeds could share their seeds with their neighbours.

Hence, the researchers contacted the $75$ farmers allocated to receive the hybrid seeds; none of the contacted farmers reported selling or giving seeds to other farmers. 
This extra step increased the internal validity of the study.
:::


Maximizing internal validity in *observational studies* is more difficult than in experimental studies (e.g., random allocation is not possible).
The internal validity of *experimental studies* involving people is often compromised because people must be informed that they are participating in a study.

## Limitations related to external validity {#InterpretGeneralisability}
\index{Limitations!external validity (generalizability)}


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-share-11-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


External validity refers to the ability to *generalise* the findings made from the sample to the entire *intended* population (Sect.\ \@ref(IntroExternalValidity)).
For a study to be externally valid, it must first be internally valid: that is, if the study of not effective in the sample studied (i.e., internally valid), the results may not apply to the intended population either.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
External validity refers to how well the sample is likely to represent the *intended population* in the RQ.

If the population is Californians, then the study is externally valid if the sample is representative of Californians
The results *do not* have to apply to people in the rest of the United States (though this can be commented on, too) to be externally valid.
The intended population is *Californians*.
:::


External validity depends on *how* the sample was obtained.
Results from random samples (Sect.\ \@ref(RandomSamplingMethods)) are likely to generalise to the population and be externally valid.
(The analyses in this book assume all samples are *simple random samples*.)
Furthermore, results from approximately representative samples (Sect.\ \@ref(Representative-samples)) may generalise to the population and be externally valid if those *in* the study are not obviously different than those *not in* the study.


Any inclusion criteria,\index{Inclusion criteria} exclusion criteria\index{Inclusion criteria} or control variables\index{Variables!control} may also limit the external validity of the study.


::: {.example #ExternalNZ name="External validity"}
A New Zealand study [@data:Gammon2012:B12] identified (for well-documented reasons) a *population* of interest: 'women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand' (p.\ 21).
The women in the *sample* were 'women of South Asian origin [...] recruited using a convenience sample method throughout Auckland' (p.\ 21).

The results may not generalise to the *intended* population (*all* women of South Asian origin living in New Zealand) because all the women in the sample came from Auckland, and the sample was not a *random* sample from this population anyway.
The study was still useful however, since we have still learnt information about the population that the is represented by the sample, which may be *similar* to the intended population.
:::


::: {.example #ExternalBiochar name="Using biochar"}
@farrar2018short studied growing ginger using biochar on one farm at Mt Mellum, Australia.
The results may only generalise to growing ginger at Mt Mellum,  but since ginger is usually grown in similar types of climates and soils, the results *may* apply to other ginger farms also.
:::


## Limitations related to ecological validity {#InterpretApplicability}
\index{Limitations!ecological (practicality)}

The likely *practicality* of the study results in the real world should also be discussed.
This is called *ecological validity*.


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-recycling-9-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #EcologicalValidity name="Ecological validity"}
A study is *ecologically valid* if the study methods, materials and context closely approximate the real situation of interest.
:::


Studies don't *need* to be ecologically valid to be useful; much can be learnt under special conditions, as long as the potential limitations are understood when applying the results to the real world.
The ecological validity of experimental studies may be compromised because the experimental conditions are sometimes highly controlled (for good reason).

::: {.example #EcologicalCups name="Ecological validity"}
Consider a study to determine the proportion of people that buy coffee in a reusable cup.
People could be *asked* about their behaviour.
This study may not be ecologically valid, as what people *do* may not align with what they *say* they will do.

An alternative study could *watch* people buy coffee at various coffee shops, and record what people *do* in practice.
This second study is more likely to be *ecologically valid*, as real-world behaviour is observed.
:::


:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
A study observed the effect of using high-mounted rear brake lights [@data:Kahgane1998:RearBrakeLights], which are now commonplace.
The American study showed that such lights reduced rear-end collisions by about $50$%.
However, after making these lights mandatory, rear-end collisions reduced by only $5$%. 
Why?

## Chapter summary {#Chap9-Summary}

The limitations in a study need to be identified, and may be related to:

* *internal validity* (effectiveness): how well the study is conducted within the sample, isolating the relationship of interest.
* *external validity* (generalisability): how well the sample results are likely to apply to the intended population.
* *ecological validity* (practicality): how well the results may apply to the real-world situation of interest.


## Quick review questions {#Chap9-QuickReview}

Are the following statements *true* or *false*?

1. When interpreting the results of a study, the steps taken to maximize internal validity should be evaluated. `r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( TRUE)}`
2. If studies are not externally valid, then they are not useful. `r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( FALSE)}`
3. When interpreting the results of a study, the steps taken to maximize external validity do not need to be evaluated. `r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf( FALSE)}`
4. When interpreting the results of a study, ecological validity is about the impact of the study on the environment.
