The parameter can be either a difference between two population proportions, or a population odds ratio.
For example, the parameter could be difference between population proportion students of eating most meals *off*-campus, comparing students living with their parents, to students *not* living with their parents.
Alternatively (and equivalently), the parameter could be the population OR of odds of eating most meals *off*-campus, comparing students living with their parents, to students *not* living with their parents.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The table can be constructed with either variable as the rows or the columns.
However, software commonly compares *rows*, so it makes sense to place the groups to be compared (i.e., the explanatory variable) in the rows of the table.

Then, the difference between the two proportions are usually calculated as the Row\ 1 proportion minus the Row\ 2 proportion.
Similarly, the odds then can be interpreted as\index{Odds ratio!interpreting}\index{jamovi output!Odds ratios} comparing Column\ 1 counts to Column\ 2 counts, and the *odds ratio* as comparing the Row\ 1 odds to the Row\ 2 odds.
:::


The RQ and the hypotheses can be written as comparing *proportions* (Sect.\ \@ref(CompareTwoProportions)), comparing *odds* (Sect.\ \@ref(CompareTwoOdds)), or about *odds ratios*.
Means are *not* appropriate (the data contain two *qualitative* variables).


Since two groups are being compared, subscripts are used to distinguish between the statistics for the two groups; say, Groups\ $A$ and\ $B$ in general (Table\ \@ref(tab:ORHT)).

## Comparing two proportions: $z$-test {#CompareTwoProportions}

To compare the two proportions, the two-tailed RQ is:

> Is the *population* proportion of students eating most meals off-campus the same for students *living with* their parents and for students *not living with* their parents?

We use $N$ to refer to students *not* living with their parents, ad $L$ for students living with their parents.
Then, following Table\ \@ref(tab:ORHT), the *parameter* in the RQ is the difference between population means: $p_L - p_N$.
As usual, the population values are unknown, so this is estimated using the statistic $\hat{p}_L - \hat{p}_N$.

Hypothesis testing always begins by assuming that the null hypothesis is true (Sect.\ \@ref(HypothesisNull)).
In this context, that means assuming that the population proportion of eating most meals off-campus is the same in both groups.
As a result, the data from the two groups can be combined to determine an overall (or common) proportion of students eating most meals off-campus:  
\[
  \hat{p} = \frac{52 + 105}{52 + 105 + 2 + 24} = \frac{157}{183} = 0.85792.
\]
This is the overall proportion of students eating most meals off-campus, assuming no difference between students living with and not with their parents.

The two *sample* proportions will vary from sample to sample and so have a sampling distribution (as in Sect.\ \@ref(OnePropTestSamplingDist)).
The standard error of $\hat{p}$ for each sample is computed using this common proportion, using the same idea as in Eq.\ \@ref(eq:StdErrorPknown):  
\begin{align*}
  \text{s.e.}(p_L) &= \sqrt{ \frac{p\times(1 - p)}{n_L}} = \sqrt{ \frac{0.85792\times(1 - 0.85792)}{54}} = 0.047511;
  \text{and}\\
  \text{s.e.}(p_N) &= \sqrt{ \frac{p\times(1 - p)}{n_N}} = \sqrt{ \frac{0.85792\times(1 - 0.85792)}{129}} = 0.030739.
\end{align*}
The difference between the proportions will vary from sample to sample too, and hence have a sampling distribution.
The standard error of this sampling distribution for the *difference* between the proportions is
\[
  \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B) = \sqrt{ \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_L)^2 +  \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_N)^2 }
  =
  \sqrt{ 0.047511^2 + 0.030739^2} = 0.056588,
\]
similar to Eq.\ \@ref(eq:SEtwoproportionsCI).


::: {.definition #DEFSamplingDistributionDiffProportions name="Sampling distribution for the difference between two sample proportions"}
The *sampling distribution of the difference between two sample proportions* $\hat{p}_A$ and $\hat{p}_B$ is (when the appropriate conditions are met; Sect.\ \@ref(Validity-Test-ChiSq)) described by:

* an approximate normal distribution,
* centred around a sampling mean whose value is ${p_{A}} - {p_{B}}$, the difference between the *population* proportions (from $H_0$),
* with a standard deviation, called the standard error of the difference between the proportions, of $\displaystyle\text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B)$.

The standard error for the difference between the proportions is 
\[
  \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B) = \sqrt{ \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A)^2 +  \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_B)^2 },
\]
where 
\[
  \text{s.e.}(p_A) = \sqrt{ \frac{p\times(1 - p)}{n_A}}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \text{s.e.}(p_B) = \sqrt{ \frac{p\times(1 - p)}{n_B}}
\]
where $p$ is the common (overall) proportion.
:::


Since the sampling distribution has an approximate normal distribution, the test statistic is\index{Test statistic!$z$-score}  
\[
  z = \frac{ (\hat{p}_L - \hat{p}_N) - (p_L - p_N) }{\text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B)} \
    = \frac{ 0.14901 - 0}{0.056588} 
    = 2.633
\]
Since the test-statistic is a $z$-score, the $P$-value can be computed from normal distributions (Sect.\ \@ref(ExactAreasUsingTables)) or from software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi)).
The two-tailed $P$-value reported by jamovi (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi), under the column `p`) is indeed small: $0.008$ to three decimals.

A very small $P$-value ($0.008$ to three decimals) means strong evidence exists to supporting $H_1$: the evidence suggests a difference between the *population* proportions.
We write:

> The *sample* provides strong evidence ($z = 2.63$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$) that the proportion of students in the *population* of having most meals off-campus is different for students living with their parents (proportion: $0.963$) and students *not* living with their parents (proportion: $0.814$; difference: $0.149$; $95$%\ CI from $0.0633$ and $0.235$, higher for students living with their parents).

The conclusion includes three components (Sect.\ \@ref(WordingConclusion)): the *answer to the RQ*; the *evidence* used to reach that conclusion ('$z = 2.63$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$'); and some *sample summary statistics* (including the $95$%\ CI for the difference between proportions).

The conclusion also makes clear which proportion is higher.


## Comparing two odds: $\chi^2$-test {#CompareTwoOdds}

For the $2\times 2$ table of counts in Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT), odds can be compared rather than proportions:

> Are the *population odds* of students eating most meals off-campus the same for students *living with* their parents and for students *not living with* their parents?

If the odds are the same in the two groups, this is equivalent to an odds ratio of one.
Hence, the RQ could also be written as

> Is the *population odds ratio* of eating most meals off-campus, comparing students who live *with their* parents to students *not living with* their parents, equal to one?

Either way, the *parameter* is the population odds ratio, and the null hypothesis is the 'no difference, no change, no relationship' position:

* $H_0$: The *population* OR is one; or (equivalently):  
  \phantom{$H_0$:{}} The *population* odds are the same in each group.

This hypothesis proposes that the *sample* odds are not the same in the two groups only due to sampling variation.
This is the initial *assumption*.
The alternative hypothesis is

* $H_1$: The *population* OR is not one; or (equivalently):  
  \phantom{$H_0$:{}} The *population* odds are *not* the same in each group.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
For comparing odds, the alternative hypotheses *is always two-tailed*.
:::


In our example then:

* $H_0$: The *population* odds of eating most meals off-campus are the *same* for students living *with* their parents and for students *not living* with their parents.
* $H_1$: The *population* odds of eating most meals off-campus are *different* for students living *with* their parents and for students *not living* with their parents.

As usual, the decision-making process starts by *assuming* the null hypothesis is true: that the *population* odds ratio is one (i.e., the population odds in each group are equal).



### Finding expected counts {#ExpectedValues}

Assuming that the odds of having most meals off-campus is the same for both groups (that is, the population OR is one), how would the sample OR be *expected* to vary from sample to sample just because of *sampling variation*?
If the null hypothesis is true, the odds are the same in both groups (and the proportions are the same in both groups).
That is, the proportions of students eating most meals off-campus is the same for students *living with* and *not living with* their parents.

Let's consider the implication.
From Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT), $157$ students out of $183$ ate most meals off-campus, so that $157\div 183 = 0.8579$ of students in the entire sample ate most of their meals off-campus.

If the proportions of students who eat most of their meals off-campus is the *same* for those who live with their parents and those who don't, then we'd *expect* $0.8579$ of students in *both* groups to be eating most meals off-campus.
(These values were also found in Sect.\ \@ref(ValidityConditionsORCI).)
That is, we would *expect*:

* A proportion of $0.8579$ of the  $54$ students who *live with their parents* (i.e., $46.33$ students) to eat most meals off-campus; and
* A proportion of $0.8579$ of the $129$ students who *don't live with their parents* (i.e., $110.67$ students) to eat most meals off-campus.

In other words, the proportions (and hence the odds) of eating most meals off-campus is the same in each group.
Those are the *expected* counts if the proportions (or odds) was exactly the same in each group (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected)), if the null hypothesis (the assumption) was true.

How close are the *observed* counts (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT)) to the *expected counts* (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected))?

* $46.33$ of the $54$ students who *live with their parents* are *expected* to eat most meals off-campus; yet we observed $52$.
* $110.67$ of the $129$ students who *don't live with their parents* are *expected* to eat most meals off-campus; yet we observed $105$.

The observed and expected counts are similar, but not the exactly same.
The difference between the observed and expected counts *may* be explained by sampling variation (that is, the null hypothesis explanation).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
You *do not* have to compute the expected values when you answer one of these types of RQs (software does it in the background).
However, seeing how the decision-making process works in this context is helpful.
:::


In previous hypothesis tests, the *sampling distribution* had an approximate normal distribution.
However, the sampling distribution of the odds ratio is more complicated^[For those interested: the *logarithm* of the sample ORs have an approximate normal distribution, and hence a *standard error*.] so will not be presented.
We will use software output to conduct the test.

### Computing the value of the test statistic {#TestStatObs}
\index{Hypothesis testing!odds ratio}

The decision-making process compares what is *expected* if the null hypothesis about the parameter is true (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected)) to what is *observed* in the sample (Table\ \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT)).
Previously, when the summary statistics were means and the sampling distribution was a normal distribution, the test statistic was a $t$-score.
However, the data here are not summarised by means, the sampling distribution is *not* a normal distribution (but is *related* to a normal distribution), and so a different test statistic is needed.

Here, the test-statistic is a 'chi-squared' statistic,  written $\chi^2$.\index{Test statistic!$\chi^2$-score}\index{chi@$\chi^2$-score}
The $\chi^2$-score measures the overall size of the differences between the expected counts and observed counts, over the entire $2\times 2$ table.

From the software (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi)), $\chi^2 = 6.934$.
But what does this value *mean*?
Is it 'large' or 'small'?

The $\chi^2$-value can be understood by finding the equivalent $z$-score, which means a $P$-value can be estimated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule.
The $\chi^2$-value is equivalent to  
\[
  z = \sqrt{\chi^2}\qquad\text{for a $2\times 2$ table}.
\]
Here, the $\chi^2$ value is equivalent to a $z$-score of $\sqrt{6.934} = 2.633$.
This is the *same* $z$-score produced when comparing two proportions (Sec.\ \@ref(CompareTwoProportions); Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi)), and hence the $P$-value will be the same also.
Using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, a small $P$-value is expected.
The two-tailed $P$-value reported by jamovi (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi), under the column `p`) is indeed small: $0.008$ to three decimals.

   
::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Recall that, for two-way tables of counts, the alternative hypotheses *are always two-tailed*, so a two-tailed $P$-value is always reported.

### Writing conclusions {#WritingConclusionChi2}

A very small $P$-value ($0.008$ to three decimals) means strong evidence exists to supporting $H_1$: the evidence suggests a difference in the *population* odds in the two groups.
We write:

> The *sample* provides strong evidence ($\chi^2 = 6.934$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$) that the odds in the *population* of having most meals off-campus is different for students living with their parents (odds: $26$) and students *not* living with their parents (odds: $4.375$; OR: $5.94$; $95$%\ CI from $1.35$ to $26.1$).

The conclusion includes three components (Sect.\ \@ref(WordingConclusion)): The *answer to the RQ*; the *evidence* used to reach that conclusion ('$\chi^2 = 6.934$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$'); and some *sample summary statistics* (including the $95$%\ CI for the odds ratio).

The conclusion also makes clear what the odds and the odds ratio *mean*.
The odds are describing as the 'odds... of having most meals off-campus', and the OR as then comparing these odds between 'students living with their parents...  and students *not* living with their parents'.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
For two-way tables, RQs are best framed in terms of ORs or comparing odds (but can be framed in terms of proportions or percentages, or associations or relationships).
Usually, RQs are easiest to write when framed in terms of comparing odds.

For consistency: if the RQ is about the odds ratio, the hypotheses and conclusion should be about the odds ratio; if the RQ is about odds, the hypotheses and conclusion should be about the odds; and so on.
:::


## Statistical validity conditions {#Validity-Test-ChiSq}
\index{Statistical validity!odds ratio}

As usual, these results hold under certain conditions.
The test above is statistically valid if: 

* All *expected* counts are at least five.

Some books may give other (but similar) conditions.

The statistical validity condition refers to the *expected* (not the *observed*) counts.
In jamovi, the *expected* counts must be explicitly requested to see if this condition is satisfied (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestExpectedjamovi)).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
If all the *observed* counts exceed five, then all *expected* counts will exceed five.
:::


If the statistical validity conditions are not met, other similar options include using a Fisher's exact test\index{Fisher's exact test}  [@conover2003practical] or using resampling methods [@efron2021computer].


```{r UniMealsTestExpectedjamovi, fig.cap="The expected values, as computed in jamovi", fig.align="center", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("jamovi/UniStudents/UniStudents-Expected.png")
```

For the student-eating data, the smallest *observed* count is $2$ (living with parents; most meals off-campus), but the smallest *expected* count is $7.67$, which is greater than five.
The size of the *expected* counts is important for the statistical validity condition.


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityEatingHT name="Statistical validity"}
For the university-student eating data, *all* the cells have an *expected* count of at least five so the statistical validity condition is satisfied.
:::


```{r}
data(PetBirds)

PB2 <- xtabs( Counts ~ Pets + LC, 
              data = PetBirds)

PB2.exp <- chisq.test(PB2)$expected 
```



## Tests of independence more generally: $\chi^2$-tests {#CompareManyProportions}

Often a tables of counts is larger than $2\times 2$.
In these situations, the RQ is worded in terms of *independence*, *relationships* or *associations* (but *not* correlations) between the variables:

> Is there a relationship (or association) between one qualitative variable and another qualitative variable?

The RQ is answered using a $\chi^2$-test comparing odds (not proportions), by extending the ideas in Sect.\ \@ref(CompareTwoOdds), as demonstrated in the following example.


:::{.example #ChiSqLarger name="Larger two-way tables"}
[*Dataset*: `RipsID`]
@diez2023rip studied Spanish people's knowledge of ocean rips (Table\ \@ref(tab:RipTableSummary), left table).
The table is a $4\times 2$ two-way table.
The RQ is

The odds and percentage of people in each age group that can correctly identify rips can be computed (Table\ \@ref(tab:RipTableSummary), right table), but this is not always possible (e.g., for a $3\times 4$ table).
Odds ratios compare *pairs* of odds, so the odds ratios in Table\ \@ref(tab:RipTableSummary) are all relative to those $51$ to $65$ (hence, no odds ratio is given for the $51$ to $65$ age group, which is the *reference level*).\index{Reference level}
For example, the odds of someone aged $18$ to $24$ correctly identifying a rip is $1.104$ times the odds of someone aged $51$ to $65$ correctly identifying a rip.

* $H_0$: In the *population*, there *is no association* between age group and being able to correctly identify a rip;
* $H_1$: In the *population*, there *is an association* between age group and being able to correctly identify a rip.

For a $2\times 2$ table, the *parameter* is the odds ratio, and the test proceeds using a $\chi^2$ value.
As in Sect.\ \@ref(CompareTwoOdds), the value of $\chi^2$ compares the observed counts to the expected counts (found in the same way as in Sect.\ \@ref(ExpectedValues)).
For two-way tables larger than $2\times 2$, defining a single parameter to describe the association between the variables is difficult.

When no relationship exists in the sample, the observed and expected values are the same, and $\chi^2 = 0$.
The larger the difference between the observed and expected values, the larger the value of $\chi^2$.
Sampling variation means that the observed values will vary from sample to sample, so that $\chi^2$ may not be exactly zero, even if there is no association between the variables.

Software computes $\chi^2 = 2.4062$ (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ripsjamovi)).
For two-way table of counts larger than $2\times 2$, this is equivalent to a $z$-score of  
\[
  z = \sqrt{\chi^2 \div \text{df}},
\]
where $\text{df}$ is the *degrees of freedom*,\index{Degrees of freedom}
where
\[
  \text{df} = (\text{number of columns of data} - 1)\times(\text{number of rows of data} - 1).
\]
Here, $\text{df} = (4 - 1)\times ( 2 - 1) = 3$, as in the output (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ripsjamovi)).
Hence, the equivalent $z$-score is  
\[
  z = \sqrt{2.4062/3} = 0.896,
\]
which is quite small, so we expected a large $P$-value.
Software confirms this (Fig. \@ref(fig:Ripsjamovi)): $P = 0.492$.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Recall that, for two-way tables of counts, the alternative hypotheses *are always two-tailed*, so a two-tailed $P$-value is always reported.
:::


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
In a chi-squared test, the value of  
\[
  \sqrt{ \chi^2 \div {\text{df}}}
\]
is like a $z$-score, where $\text{df}$ is the 'degrees of freedom' (`df` in the software output).
The degrees of freedom in a two-way table is the number of rows of data less one, times the number of columns of data less one.

This allows the $P$-value to be estimated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule.

<!-- In $2\times2$ tables, -->
<!-- this is rarely hard to determine, -->

<!-- Standardised residuals are like $z$-scores, -->

<!-- * $1.3$: Students *not living with their parents*  are *more likely* (because the residual is *positive*) to eat mostmeals on-campus -->

<!-- students living *with* their parents are -->
<!-- *less* likely to eat most meals on-campus. -->

The parameter is the odds ratio of infection, comparing natural to relocated nests.
A graphical summary is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TurtleNestsGraphs).
A numerical summary table (Table\ \@ref(tab:TurtleNestDataTable), right table) shows that the odds of natural nest being infected is $1.657$ times the odds of a relocated nest being infected.
From the jamovi output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TurtleNestsOutputjamoviHT)), the $\chi^2$-value is $0.777$.
This is like a $z$-score of $z = \sqrt{0.777/1} = 0.88$, which is very small, so expect a large $P$-value.
Indeed, the $P$-value is $0.378$ on the output.
The smallest *expected* count is $6.49$ (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TurtleNestsOutputjamoviHT)), so this test is statistically valid.
We write:

> There is no evidence of a difference in the odds of infection ($\chi^2$: $0.777$; $P$-value: $0.378$; odds ratio: $1.657$; $95$%\ CI: $0.537$ to $5.12$) between natural nests (odds: $2.90$; $n = 39$) and relocated nests (odds: $1.75$; $n = 22$).

That is, there no evidence that relocating the nest (to protect them from tidal inundation) changes the risk of infection.


:::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
We *do not* say whether the evidence supports the null hypothesis.
We assume the null hypothesis is true, so we state how strong the evidence is to support the alternative hypothesis.
The current sample presents no evidence to contradict the assumption, but future evidence may emerge.

A study of $400$ residents of  Klang Valley, Malaysia, examined residents' approach to waste management [@choon2017perception].
One RQ was:

For the numerical summary table
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:BagsTableHT), right table):'
} else {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:BagsHTNumerical)):'
}`

* For those '$30$ or under': the *odds* of bringing a shopping bag is $126/138 = 0.913$.
* For those '$31$ to $40$': the *odds* of bringing a shopping bag is $50/32 = 1.563$.
* For those 'Over $40$': the *odds* of bringing a shopping bag is $41/13 = 3.154$.

For computing the odds ratios, Row\ 3 is on the bottom of the fraction (as the reference level):\index{Reference level}

* The OR of bringing a shopping bag, comparing people '$30$ and under' to people 'Over $40$': $0.913/3.154 = 0.289$.
* The OR of bringing a shopping bag, comparing people '$31$--$40$' to people 'Over $40$': $1.563/3.154 = 0.496$.

That is, the odds of bringing a shopping bag for those '$30$ and under' is $0.289$ times (i.e., is smaller than) the odds of those 'Over $40$'.
Similarly, the odds of bringing a shopping bag for those '$31$ to $40$' is $0.496$ times (i.e., is smaller than) the odds of those 'Over $40$'.

The hypothesis can be worded in terms of odds, but the hypothesis are usually worded in terms of associations (but *not* correlations) for tables larger than $2\times 2$:

* $H_0$: *No association* exists between bringing a shopping bag and age group.
* $H_1$: *An association* exists between bringing a shopping bag and age group.

From the software output (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BagsChisqjamovi)), $\chi^2 = 16.24$ and $\text{df} = 2$, so this $\chi^2$ value is approximately equivalent to a $z$-score of $\sqrt{16.24\div 2} = 2.85$.
This is a large $z$-score so, using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, a small $P$-value is expected; indeed, jamovi reports $P < 0.001$.
This suggests very strong evidence in the sample that bringing a shopping bag is not the same for all three age groups.

The conclusion could be written as

> The sample provides very strong evidence ($\chi^2 = 16.24$; $\text{df} = 2$) that the odds of bringing a shopping bag is not the same for the three age groups.

Adding sample summary information to this conclusion is cumbersome.
Instead, readers canmbe pointed to the numerical summary (Table\ \@ref(tab:BagsHTNumerical)).
Furthermore, CIs are not reported since software does not always produce CIs for tables larger than $2\times 2$.

While we know there is an association between the variables, we can only speculate on the nature of the association (i.e., for which group(s) the *population* odds are different).
Comparing all *pairs* of groups increases the probability of *incorrectly* declaring a difference between the odds (increasing the chance of a Type\ I error;\index{Type I error} Sect.\ \@ref(TypeErrors))
The correct approach requires methods beyond this book.

All *expected* values exceed $5$ (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BagsChisqjamovi)), so the results are statistically valid.


## Chapter summary {#TestsOddsRatio-Summary}

To test a hypothesis about a difference between two population proportions $p_A - p_B$:

* Write the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$).
* Initially *assume* the value of $(p_A - p_B)$ in the null hypothesis to be true.
* Then, describe the *sampling distribution*, which describes what to *expect*  from the difference between the sample proportions based on this assumption: under certain statistical validity conditions, the difference between the sample proportions vary with:
   *  an approximate normal distribution,
   *  with sampling mean whose value is the value of $(p_A - p_B)$ (from $H_0$), and
   *  having a standard deviation of $\displaystyle \text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B)$.
* Compute the value of the *test statistic*:  
\[
   z = \frac{ (\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B) - (p_A - p_B)}{\text{s.e.}(\hat{p}_A - \hat{p}_B)},
\]
where $p_A - p_B$ is the hypothesised difference given in the null hypothesis.
* The $t$-value is like a $z$-score, and so an approximate *$P$-value* can be estimated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, or found using software.

To test a hypothesis for comparing two odds, or to test for a relationship between two qualitative variables more generally:

* Write the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$).
* Initially *assume* no relationship between the two variables.
* Find the value of the *test statistic* (a $\chi^2$-score) on the software output.
* The equivalent $z$-score is $\sqrt{\chi^2\div\text{df}}$ where $\text{df}$ is the 'degress of freedom' and can be found on the software output.
* An approximate *$P$-value* can be estimated using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, or found using software.

::: {.exercise #ComplianceHT}
[*Dataset*: `XXXXXXXXXXXXX`]
@soud2009isolation studied the compliance of students with an isolation request following a large mumps outbreak in Kansas in 2006.
One RQ was:

> Is there an association between age group, and compliance with the isolation order?

The data are shown in Table\ \@ref(tab:MumpsTable).

1. Write down the hypotheses.
1. Compute the proportion of each age group that complied with the isolation request.
1. Compute the odds of each age group that complied with the isolation request.
1. Compute the relevant odds ratios, and interpret what these mean.
1. Determine the $\chi^2$ value and perform a hypothesis to answer the RQ, using the output in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:Mumpsjamovi).
1. Determine the number of degrees freedom.
1. Compute the equivalent $z$-score for this $\chi^2$-value.
1. Write down the conclusion.
1. Is the test statistically valid?
