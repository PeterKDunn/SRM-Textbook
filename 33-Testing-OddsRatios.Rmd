In Sect. \@ref(OddsRatioIntro), a study was introduced that examined the eating habits of university students [@data:Mann12017:UniStudents].
Researchers classified $n = 183$ students into groups according to two qualitative variables (Table \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT)): Where they lived, and where they ate most of their meals.

The parameter is the population OR, comparing the odds of eating most meals *off*-campus, for students living with their parents to students *not* living with their parents.


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
Understanding how software computes the odds ratio is important for understanding the output.
In a two-by-two table, jamovi and SPSS output can be interpreted in *either* of these ways (i.e., both are correct):

* The *odds* compare Row 1 counts to Row 2 counts, for both columns.  
  Then the odds ratio compares the odds for Column 1 to the odds for Column 2.

* The *odds* compare Column 1 counts to Column 2 counts.  
  Then the odds ratio compares the odds for Row 1 to the odds for Row 2.
  
Odds and odds ratios are computed with the **last row** and **last column** values on the *bottom* of the fraction.
:::


:::{.example name="Odds and odds ratio in software"}
For the data in Table \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT), the software output can be interpreted in *either* of these ways (i.e., both are correct): 

* The *odds* are the odds of eating most meals *off-campus* (Row 1) compared to *on-campus* (Row 2; on the bottom of the fraction)
  * for students living with their parents (Column 1): $52/2 = 26$;
  * for students not living with their parents (Column 2): $105/24 = 4.375$. 
  
  So the OR is $26/4.375 = 5.943$ (Column 2 on bottom of the fraction), as in the output (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTSPSS)).

* The *odds* are the odds of living with parents (Column 1) compared to not living with parents (Column 2; on the bottom of the fraction):

  * for those eating most meals off-campus: $52/105 = 0.49524$;
  * for those eating most meals on-campus: and $2/24 = 0.083333$.
  
  So the OR is $0.49524/0.083333 = 5.943$ (Row2  on bottom of the fraction), as in the output (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTSPSS)).

In other words, the odds and odds ratios use the last row or last column on the bottom of the fraction.
:::


The RQ can be written in terms of comparing proportions, odds, or odds ratios.
Importantly, means are not appropriate (the data contain two *qualitative* variables.)
Usually the odds ratio (OR) is used as the parameter; one reason is that software produces output related to testing the OR. 
Using the OR, the RQ could be written as

> Is the *population odds ratio* of eating most meals off-campus, comparing students who live *with their* parents to students *not living with* their parents, equal to one?

Alternatively, but probably easier to understand, is to write the RQ in terms of comparing the odds in the two groups explicitly:

> Are the *population odds* of students eating most meals off-campus the same for students *living with* their parents and for students *not living with* their parents?

The RQ can also be worded as comparing the percentage (or proportion) of students eating meals off-campus in each group.
This is equivalent to the RQs above, but is not directly related to the software output (which works with odds ratios).

Another alternative, which sounds less direct but is useful for two-way tables larger than $2\times 2$ (see Sect. \@ref(ORTestDumping)), is worded in terms of *relationships* or *associations* between the variables:

> Is there a relationship (or association) between where students eat most of their meals and whether or not the student lives with their parents?

All of these are equivalent.
Usually, for $2 \times2$ tables, working with *odds* or *odds ratios* is best, because most software (including jamovi and SPSS) readily produce CIs for the odds ratio.


## Statistical hypotheses and notation

For two-way tables of counts, the *parameter* is the population odds ratio.
As usual, the null hypothesis is the 'no difference, no change, no relationship' position so, in this context:

* $H_0$: The *population* OR is one; or (equivalently):  The *population* odds are the same in each group.

This hypothesis proposes that the *sample* odds are not the same due to sampling variation.
This is the initial *assumption*.
The alternative hypothesis is

* $H_1$: The *population* OR is not one; or (equivalently):  The *population* odds are *not* the same in each group.

The alternative hypothesis is *always* two-tailed for analysing two-way tables of counts.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
For analysing two-way tables of counts, the alternative hypotheses *are always two-tailed*.
:::


The hypotheses can also be written in terms of differences in percentages (or proportions), though the software output is usually expressed in terms of odds.
The hypotheses can also be written in terms of associations:

* $H_0$: In the *population*, there is *no association* between the two variables
* $H_1$: In the *population*, there is *an association* between the two variables


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The RQ and hypotheses only need to be given in *one* of these ways.
The RQ and hypotheses should be consistent; for example, if the RQ is written in terms of odds, the hypotheses should be written in terms of odds.
:::


As usual, the [decision-making process](#DecisionMaking) starts by *assuming* that the null hypothesis is true: that the *population* odds ratio is one.


## Finding expected values {#ExpectedValues}

Assuming that the odds of having most meals off-campus is the same for both groups (that is, the population OR is one), how would the sample OR be *expected* to vary from sample to sample just because of *sampling variation*?
If the null hypothesis is true, the odds are the same in both groups (and the percentages are the same in both groups).
That is, the percentage of students eating most meals off-campus is the same for students *living with* and *not living with* their parents.

Let's consider the implication.
From Table \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT), 157 students out of 183 ate most meals off-campus, so that

\[
   \frac{157}{183} \times 100 = 85.79\%
\]
of the students in the entire sample  ate most of their meals off-campus.

If the percentage of students who eat most of their meals off-campus is the *same* for those who live with their parents and those who don't, then we'd **expect** 85.79% of students in *both* groups to be eating most meals off-campus.
That is, we would *expect*:

* 85.79% of the 54 students who *live with their parents*  (i.e., 46.33) to eat most meals off-campus; and
* 85.79% of the 129 students who *don't live with their parents* (i.e., 110.67) to eat most meals off-campus.

In other words, the percentage (and hence the odds) is the same in each group.
Those are the *expected* numbers if the percentage was exactly the same in each group (Table \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected)), if the null hypothesis (the assumption) was true.


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
Consider the expected counts in Table \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected).
Confirm that the *odds* of having most meals off-campus is the same for students living with their parents, and for students not living with their parents.\label{thinkBox:ExpectedOddsSame}

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
`r webexercises::hide()`
* Living with parents: 46.333/7.667 = 6.043$.
* Not living with parents: 110.667/18.333 = 6.036$.

The odds are the same (the small difference is because the expected counts are only given to three decimal places).
`r webexercises::unhide()`
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`
:::

How do those *expected values* compare to what was *observed*?

* 46.333 of the 54 students who *live with their parents* are *expected* to eat most meals off-campus; yet we observed 52.
* 110.667 of the 129 students who *don't live with their parents* are *expected* to eat most meals off-campus; yet we observed 105.

The observed and expected counts are similar, but not the exactly same.
The difference between the observed and expected counts *may* be explained by sampling variation (that is, the null hypothesis explanation).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
You **do not** have to compute the expected values when you answer one of these types of RQs (software does it in the background).
However, seeing how the decision-making process works in this context is helpful.
:::


In previous hypothesis tests, the *sampling distribution* of the sample statistic was described, as having an approximate normal distribution (whose standard deviation is called the *standard error*).
However, the sampling distribution of the odds ratio is more complicated^[For those interested: The *logarithm* of the sample ORs have an approximate normal distribution, and a *standard error*.] so will not be presented.

## Computing the test statistic: comparing odds {#TestStatObs}

The [decision-making process](#DecisionMaking) compares what is *expected* if the null hypothesis about the parameter is true (Table \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHTExpected)) to what is **observed** in the sample (Table \@ref(tab:MealsDataTableHT)).
Previously, when the summary statistics were means, $t$-tests were used as the test statistic.
However, the data here are not summarised by means, and a different test statistic (related to a normal distribution; see below) is needed.

Here, the test-statistic is a 'chi-squared' statistic,  written $\chi^2$.
A $\chi^2$ statistic measures the overall size of the differences between the expected counts and observed counts, over the entire table.


:::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}

::: {style="display: flex;"}
The Greek letter $\chi$ is pronounced 'ki', as in **ki**te (**not** "chi" as in **Chi**na).  
The test statistic $\chi^2$ is pronounced as 'chi-squared'.

From the software (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTSPSS)), $\chi^2 = 6.934$.
In a $2\times 2$ table of counts (when the 'degrees of freedom', or `df`, is equal to 1, as in the computer output), the *square root* of the $\chi^2$ value is approximately equivalent to a $z$-score. 
So here, the equivalent $z$-score is about $\sqrt{6.934} = 2.63$, which is fairly large for a $z$-score: a small $P$-value is expected.

More generally, for two-way tables of any size, $\sqrt{\chi^2 \div \text{df}}$ is like a $z$-score, where df is the 'degrees of freedom' (related to the size of the table^[For those interested: the degrees of freedom in a two-way table is the number of rows of data less one, times the number of columns of data less one. So, for a $2\times 2$ table, $\text{df} = (2 - 1) \times (2 - 1) = 1$.]), as shown in the software output.
This allows a $P$-value to be estimated using the 68--95--99.7 rule from the value of the $\chi^2$ statistic.

In a chi-squared test, with a given number of 'degrees of freedom' (`df` in the software output), the value of
\[
  \sqrt{ \chi^2 \div {\text{df}}}
\]
is like a $z$-score.
This allows the $P$-value to be estimated using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule).
:::


## Determining $P$-values

The differences between the observed sample statistic (the sample OR) and the hypothesised population parameter (the population OR of one) is summarised by $\chi^2 = 6.934$, approximately equivalent to $z = 2.63$.
Using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule), a small $P$-value is expected.

The two-tailed $P$-value reported by jamovi (Fig. \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTjamovi), under the `p` column) and SPSS (Fig. \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTSPSS), in the `Asymptotic Significance (2-sided)` column and `Pearson Chi-Square` row) is very small: $0.008$ to three decimals.

   
::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Recall that, for two-way tables of counts, the alternative hypotheses *are always two-tailed*, so a two-tailed $P$-value is always reported.

## Writing conclusions

As usual, a very small $P$-value ($0.008$ to three decimals) means [very strong evidence](#tab:PvaluesInterpretation) exists to supporting $H_1$: the evidence suggests a difference in the *population* odds in the two groups.
We write:

> The *sample* provides strong evidence ($\chi^2 = 6.934$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$) that the odds in the *population* of having most meals off-campus is different for students living with their parents (odds: 26) and students *not* living with their parents (odds: 4.375; OR: $5.94$; 95% CI from $1.35$ to $26.1$).

Again, as seen in Sect. \@ref(WordingConclusion), the conclusion includes three components:
(a) The *answer to the RQ*; (b) the *evidence* used to reach that conclusion  ('$\chi^2 = 6.934$; two-tailed $P = 0.008$'); and (c) some *sample summary statistics*  (including the 95% CI for the odds ratio).

The conclusion also makes clear what the odds and the odds ratio *mean*.
The odds are describing as the 'odds... of having most meals off-campus', and the OR as then comparing these odds between 'students living with their parents...  and students *not* living with their parents'.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
For two-way tables, RQs are best framed in terms of ORs or odds (but can be framed in terms of proportions or percentages, or associations or relationships).
\smallskip

For consistency: if the RQ is about the odds ratio, the hypotheses and conclusion should be about the odds ratio; if the RQ is about odds, the hypotheses and conclusion should be about the odds; and so on.

<!-- this is rarely hard to determine, -->
<!-- but in other size two-way table (such as a $4\times 3$ table, for example) it can be more challenging. -->
<!-- To help determine where the difference are located, -->
<!-- we can ask SPSS^[Using `Analyze> Descriptive Statistics> Crosstabs...`, and then in the `Cells` tab select `Residuals> Standardized`.] to produce  -->
<!-- *standardized residuals* -->
<!-- (Table \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestSPSSStdRes)). -->

<!-- knitr::include_graphics("SPSS/UniStudents/UniStudentsStdRes.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->



<!-- Standardised residuals are like $z$-scores, -->
<!-- so that cells in the table with a standardized residual larger than about $2$ -->
<!-- mean that the observed counts were *higher* than we would have expected, -->
<!-- and -->
<!-- that cells in the table with a standardized residual smaller than about $-2$ -->
<!-- mean that the observed counts were *smaller* than we would have expected. -->
<!-- So for the uni-student data -->
<!-- (Table \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestSPSSStdRes)), -->
<!-- we can find the largest and smallest standardized residuals: -->

<!-- * $-2.0$: Students *living with their parents* are *less likely* (because the residual is *negative*) to eat most meals on-campus -->
<!--    (compared to what we'd expect by chance). -->
<!-- * $1.3$: Students *not living with their parents*  are *more likely* (because the residual is *positive*) to eat mostmeals on-campus -->
<!--    (compared to what we'd expect by chance); -->

<!-- So while the $\chi^2$-square suggests there is a difference, -->
<!-- the standardised residuals tells us *how* they are different: -->
<!-- students living *with* their parents are -->
<!-- *less* likely to eat most meals on-campus. -->
<!-- Again, -->
<!-- standardized residuals may not be needed here to reach these conclusions, -->
<!-- but they can be used in larger two-way tables -->
<!-- (for example,  -->

## Statistical validity conditions {#Validity-Test-ChiSq}

As usual, these results hold [under certain conditions](#exm:StatisticalValidityAnalogy).
The test above is statistically valid if: 

* All *expected* counts are at least five.

Some books may give other (but similar) conditions.

The statistical validity condition refers to the *expected* (not the *observed*) counts.
SPSS tells us if this condition is not satisfied, underneath the *first* output table in Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:UniMealsTestOutputHTSPSS).
In jamovi, the *expected* counts must be explicitly requested to see if this condition is satisfied (Fig. \@ref(fig:UniMealsTestExpectedjamovi)).


```{r UniMealsTestExpectedjamovi, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The expected values, as computed in jamovi", fig.align="center", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("jamovi/UniStudents/UniStudents-Expected.png")
```

For the student-eating data, the smallest *observed* count is 2 (living with parents; most meals off-campus), but the smallest *expected* count is 7.67, which is greater than five.
The size of the *expected* counts is important for the statistical validity condition.


::: {.example #StatisticalValidityEatingHT name="Statistical validity"}
For the university-student eating data, *all* the cells have an expected count of at least five so the statistical validity condition is satisfied.

A study examined people with lung cancer, and a matched set of similar controls who did not have lung cancer, and compared the proportion in each group that had pet birds [@data:Kohlmeier1992:BirdsCancer].
These data were studied in Sect. \@ref(PetBirdsOR); the data are shown again in Table \@ref(tab:BirdsData2), and the numerical summary in Table \@ref(tab:BirdsDataSummary) (the computations are in Sect. \@ref(PetBirdsOR)).


```{r BirdsData2,  echo=FALSE}
PB2T <- cbind( PB2, 
               "Total" = rowSums(PB2))
PB2T <- rbind( PB2T, 
               "Total" = colSums(PB2T))

if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  kable(PB2T,
        format = "latex",
        booktabs = TRUE,
        longtable = FALSE,
        caption = "The pet bird data") %>% 
    column_spec(4, bold = TRUE) %>%
    row_spec(3, bold = TRUE) %>%
    row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
    row_spec(2, hline_after = TRUE) %>%
    kable_styling(font_size = 10)
}
if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
  out <- kable(PB2T,
               format = "html",
               booktabs = TRUE,
               longtable = FALSE,
               caption = "The pet bird data")

     row_spec(3, bold = TRUE)
  } else {

  }
     
}
```

Consider this RQ:

> Are the **odds** of having a pet bird the same for people *with* lung cancer (cases) and for people *without* lung cancer (controls)?

The parameter is the population OR, comparing the odds of keeping a pet bird, for adults with lung cancer to adults who do not have lung cancer.


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The RQ could also be written in terms of comparing the *percentage* in each groups; in terms of the *odds ratio* being one; or in terms of a *relationship* between the two variabes
:::


From this RQ (written in terms of *odds*), the hypotheses could be written as:

* $H_0$: The *odds* of having a pet bird is *the same* for people *with* lung cancer (cases) and for people *without* lung cancer (controls).
* $H_1$: The *odds* of having a pet bird is *not the same* for people *with* lung cancer (cases) and for people *without* lung cancer (controls).


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
The null hypothesis could also be written as:
  
*  The **percentage** of people having a pet bird is *the same* for people *with* lung cancer (cases) and for people *without* lung cancer (controls).
*  The **odds ratio** of people having a pet bird, comparing people *with* lung cancer (cases) and for people *without* lung cancer (controls), is equal to one.
*  There is **no relationship** between having a pet bird and having lung cancer.
:::


Begin *assuming* the null hypothesis is true: no difference exists between the odds in the *population*.
Based on this assumption, the *expected* counts can be found (though, in practice, you do not have to compute these).
From the data (Table \@ref(tab:BirdsData2)), overall $199\div 668 = 29.79$% of people own a pet bird.

If there really was no difference in the odds (or the percentages) of owning a pet bird between those with and without lung cancer, about $29.79$% of the people in *both* lung cancer groups would be *expected* to own a pet bird.
 

```{r BirdsDataSummary,  echo=FALSE}
PBsummary <- array( dim = c(3, 3) )

colnames(PBsummary) <- c( "Odds of keeping pet bird",
                          "Percentage keeping pet bird",
                          "Sample size")
rownames(PBsummary) <- c("With lung cancer:",
                         "Without lung cancer:",

PBsummary[1, ] <- c("0.6950", 
                    "41.0%",

PBsummary[2, ] <- c("0.3079",

                    "", 
                    "")


if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  kable(PBsummary,
        format = "latex",
        booktabs = TRUE,
        longtable = FALSE,
        #align=c("p{28mm}", "p{28mm}", "c"),

}
```

About 29.79% of the 239 lung-cancer cases (or 71.20 people) would be expected to have a pet bird, and about 29.79% of the 429 non-lung-cancer cases (or 127.80 people) would be expected to have a pet bird.
A table of these *expected counts* (Table \@ref(tab:PetBirdsExpected)) shows that all are greater than five.
In practice, software compues these expected counts automatically.


```{r PetBirdsExpected,  echo=FALSE}
PBExp <- PB2T 

PBExp[1, ] <- c(71.20, 
                127.80, 
		199)
PBExp[2, ] <- c(167.80,
                301.20, 
		469) 

if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  kable(PBExp,
        format = "latex",
        booktabs = TRUE,
        longtable = FALSE,
        caption = "The expected counts for the pet bird data, if the proportion owning pet birds was the same for lung cancer cases and non-lung-cancer cases") %>%
   column_spec(4, bold = TRUE) %>%
   row_spec(3, bold = TRUE) %>%
   row_spec(2, hline_after = TRUE) %>%
   kable_styling(font_size = 10)
}
if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
  out <- kable(PBExp,
               format = "html",
               booktabs = TRUE,
               longtable = FALSE,
               caption = "The expected counts for the pet bird data, if the proportion owning pet birds was the same for lung cancer cases, and non-lung-cancer cases")
  if ( knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub")) {
     column_spec(out, 
                 4, 
		 bold = TRUE) %>%
     row_spec(3, bold = TRUE)
  } else {
    out
  }
     
}
```


The counts in Table \@ref(tab:PetBirdsExpected) are what are *expected*, *if* the percentage of people owning a pet bird is the same for lung cancer and non-lung cancer cases.
How close are the expected and observed counts (Table \@ref(tab:BirdsData2))?

To compare the sample statistic (what we *observed*) with the hypothesised population parameter, software computes the $\chi^2$ value (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:PetBirdsjamovi); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:PetBirdsSPSS)): $\chi^2 = 22.374$, approximately equivalent to a $z$-score of $\sqrt{22.374/1} = 4.730$, which is very large.
Hence, a small $P$-value is expected.

The software shows the $P$-value is very small ($P < 0.001$).
As usual, this means that [very strong evidence](#tab:PvaluesInterpretation) exists to support $H_1$, if $H_0$ is assumed true.
That is, the evidence suggests a *difference* exists between the two odds in the *population*.
We write:

> The *sample* provides very strong evidence ($\chi^2 = 22.374$; two-tailed  $P < 0.001$) that the odds in the *population* of having a pet bird is not the same for people with lung cancer (odds: 0.695) and for people without lung cancer (odds: 0.308; OR: $2.26$; 95% CI from $1.6$ to $3.2$).

## Example: B12 deficiency {#B12Deficiency}


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">

A study in New Zealand [@data:Gammon2012:B12] asked:

> Among a certain group of women, are the odds of being vitamin B12 deficient different for women on a vegetarian diet compared to women on a non-vegetarian diet?

The population was 'predominantly overweight/obese women of South Asian origin living in Auckland'.
The RQ could be worded in terms of odds ratios or proportions, too.
The statistical hypotheses are:
 
* $H_0$: $\text{population odds for vegetarians} = \text{population odds for non-vegetarians}$:
  The odds of B12 deficiency are the same in both groups.
* $H_1$:  $\text{population odds for vegetarians} \ne \text{population odds for non-vegetarians}$:
  The odds of B12 deficiency are *not* the same in both groups.

The parameter is the population OR, comparing the odds of being B12 deficient, for vegetarians to non-vegetarians.

```{block2, type="extraInfo"}
Again (see Sect. \@ref(ExampleHTPetBirds)), the RQ and the hypotheses could be written in terms of comparing the *percentages*, in terms of the *odds ratio* being equal to one, or in terms of *relationships* between the variables.
```

Here, the odds refer to the odds of a woman being B12 deficient.
The data are shown in Table \@ref(tab:B12Data), and the numerical summary in Table \@ref(tab:B12DataSummary).
Since the RQ is about odds, a side-by-side bar chart is produced (Fig. \@ref(fig:B12Barcharts)) as the graphical summary.

The software output (jamovi: Fig. \@ref(fig:B12jamoviOutputHT); SPSS: Fig. \@ref(fig:B12SPSSOutputHT)) gives the OR (and 95% CI) as $3.154$ ($1.077$ to $9.238$).
The chi-square value is $4.707$, approximately equivalent to $z$-score of $\sqrt{ {4.707}\div{1}} = 2.17$; a small $P$-value is expected using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule).
Software output shows that the two-tailed $P$-value is $0.030$, which is indeed 'small'.
We conclude:

> The sample provides *moderate evidence* ($\chi^2 = 4.707$; $P = 0.030$) that the odds in the population of being vitamin B12 deficient is different for vegetarian women (odds: 0.3077) compared to non-vegetarian women (odds: 0.0976; OR: $3.2$; 95% CI: $1.1$ to $9.2$).

The statistically valid shoud be checked.
The jamovi output (Fig. \@ref(fig:B12jamoviOutputHT)) shows that the smallest expected count is 4.39.
The text under the *first* table of SPSS output in Fig. \@ref(fig:B12SPSSOutputHT) shows similar information.
Since the smallest expected count is *smaller* than five, the results may be statistically invalid.
Nonetheless, only *one* cell has an expected count less than five, and only *just* under 5, so we shouldn't be too concerned (but it should be noted).

A study of dumping households goods on the kerbside in Brisbane [@comerford2018motivations] asked people their opinions on the dumping.
All participants were from Brisbane suburbs where a high level of kerbside dumping occurred.
The data (Table \@ref(tab:DumpingTable)) are given in a $2\times 3$ table of counts, so defining a parameter is difficult.


```{r DumpingTable, echo=FALSE}
DumpTab <- array( dim = c(2, 3))

DumpTab[1, ] <- c(22, 15, 18)
DumpTab[2, ] <- c(6, 1, 36)
colnames(DumpTab) <- c("Acceptable", 
                       "Conditionally acceptable", 
                       "Not acceptable")
rownames(DumpTab) <- c("Reuseable", 
                       "Non-reuseable")

if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
  kable(DumpTab,
        format = "latex",
        longtable = FALSE,
        caption = "The opinion of Brisbane residents about kerbside dumping",
        booktabs = TRUE) %>%

}
if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {

        longtable = FALSE,
        caption = "The opinion of Brisbane residents about kerbside dumping",
        booktabs = TRUE)
}
```

        align = c("r", "r", "r", "r"),
        caption = cap.tab)
}
```

In Table \@ref(tab:KerbsideHTNumerical), the odds are that the given opinion refers to **Reusable** goods (i.e., Row 2 on bottom of the fraction).
Here are some details of the calculations (notice that Column 3 is on the bottom of the fraction):

* For *Acceptable* goods: the *odds* that these are reusable goods is $22/6 = 3.6667$.
* For *Conditionally acceptable* goods: the *odds* that these are reusable goods is $15/1 = 15$.
* For *Not acceptable* goods: the *odds* that these are reusable goods is $18/36 = 0.5$.

Then the *odds ratios* can be computed:

* Comparing the odds of the goods being reusable, for *Acceptable* to *Not acceptable*: $3.6667/0.5 = 7.333$.
* Comparing the odds of the goods being reusable, for *Conditionally acceptable* to *Not acceptable*: $15/0.5 = 30$.

Since Table \@ref(tab:KerbsideHTNumerical) has *three* groups to compare, three odds are needed.
However, the summary has $3 - 1 = 2$ odds ratios, since odds *ratios* compare two odds.
The level to which the other two are compared is called the *Reference level*.
In Table \@ref(tab:KerbsideHTNumerical), the reference level is *Not acceptable* (on the bottom of the fraction; the final column).
(In a $2\times 2$ table, with *two* groups to compare, the summary has only $2 - 1 = 1$ odds ratio.)

These odds ratios mean:

* The odds that the goods are reusable is 7.333 times greater for acceptable rubbish compared to non-acceptable rubbish; and
*  The odds that the goods are reusable is 50 times greater for conditionally acceptable rubbish compared to non-acceptable rubbish.

For two-way tables larger than $2\times 2$, hypotheses are best worded in terms of *relationships* or *associations* between the two variables:

* $H_0$: There *is no* association between the type of rubbish and the opinion of kerbside dumping.
* $H_1$: There *is an* association between the type of rubbish and the opinion of kerbside dumping.

From the software output, $\chi^2 = 26.318$ and $\text{df} = 2$, so this $\chi^2$ value is approximately equivalent to a $z$-score of $\sqrt{{26.318\div}{2}} = 3.63$.
This is a large $z$-score so, using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule), a very small $P$-value is expected; indeed, the software output reports $P < 0.001$.
This suggests very strong evidence in the sample that opinions are not the same for reuseable and non-reuseable rubbish.

The conclusion could be written as

> The *sample* provides very strong evidence ($\chi^2 = 26.318$; $\text{df} = 2$) that a relationship exists in the *population*  between opinions about kerbside dumping and the type of rubbish.

While sample summary information could be added, the conclusion statements then become cumbersome.
Instead, pointing readers to the numerical summary (Table \@ref(tab:KerbsideHTNumerical)) is probably better.
Furthermore, CIs are not reported since the software does not produce CIs for tables larger than $2\times 2$.

All *expected* values all exceed 5 (Fig. \@ref(fig:KerbsideChisqjamovi); Fig. \@ref(fig:KerbsideChisqSPSS)), even though one *observed* count is less than five.
The results are statistically valid.


## Summary {#Chap31-Summary}

To test a hypothesis about a population odds ratio, based on the value of the sample odds ratio, initially **assume** the value of the population odds ratio  in the null hypothesis (usually one) to be true.
Then, **expected counts (Step 2)** can be computed.
Since the sample odds ratio varies from sample to sample, under certain statistical validity conditionsa quantity closely-related to the sample odds ratio  varies with an approximate normal distribution.
This distribution describes what values of the sample odds ratio could be **expected** in the sample if the value of the populations odds ratio  in the null hypothesis was true.
The *test statistic* is a $\chi^2$ statistic, which compares the expected and observed counts. 

The value of $\sqrt{\chi^2/\text{df}}$ is like a $z$-score,  where 'df' is the 'degrees of freedom' reported by software, and so an approximate **$P$-value** can be estimated using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule).
Software reports the $P$-value to assess whether the data are **consistent (Step 4)** with the assumption.

::: {.exercise #TestsOddsSandflies}
Researchers [@data:Christensen:sandflies] studied the number of sandflies caught in light traps set at 3 and 35 feet above ground in eastern Panama.
They asked:

> In eastern Panama, are the odds of finding a male sandfly the same at 3 feet above ground as at 35 feet above ground?

The data are compiled into a table (Table \@ref(tab:SandfliesHT)), and summarised numerically (Table \@ref(tab:SandfliesHTNumerical); partially edited) and graphically (Fig. \@ref(fig:SandfliesPlot)).
Use the jamovi output (Fig. \@ref(fig:Sandfliesjamovi)) to evaluate the evidence, complete Table \@ref(tab:SandfliesHTNumerical), and write a conclusion.

::: {.exercise #TestsOddsRatioAugustRainfallInEmerald}
The *Southern Oscillation Index* (SOI) is a standardised measure of the air pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, and has been shown to be related to rainfall in some parts of the world [@climate:stone:1996], and especially Queensland [@climate:stone:1992; @mypapers:Dunn:bootstrap:2001].

As an example [@mypapers:dunnsmyth:glms], the rainfall at Emerald (Queensland) was recorded for Augusts between 1889 to 2002 inclusive, in Augusts when the monthly average SOI was positive, and when the SOI was non-positive (that is, zero or negative), as shown in Table \@ref(tab:SOItableHT).
(This study also appeared in Exercise \@ref(exr:OddsRatiosCIAugustRainfall).)

1. Using the jamovi output in Fig. \@ref(fig:EmeraldRainjamoviOutput), perform a hypothesis test to determine if the odds of having no rain is the same Augusts 
   with non-positive and negative SOI.
1. Write down the conclusion.
1. Is the test statistically valid?

**Answers to in-chapter questions:**

- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:ExpectedOddsSame}: Living with parents: $46.333/7.667 = 6.043$; not living with parents: $110.667/18.333 = 6.036$.
  The odds are the same (the small difference is because the expected counts are only given to three decimal places).
- Sect. \ref{thinkBox:NotCauseCancer}: Because the study *observational*. 
  Confounders may explain the relationship (can you think of one?).
  In addition, maybe having lung cancer means that people seek companionship in the form of a pet (i.e., having lung cancer often comes before having the pet bird).
