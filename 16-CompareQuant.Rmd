## Introduction

Relational RQs compare groups.
This chapter considers how to compare *qualitative* variables in different groups.
Graphs are very useful this purpose, and a table of the numerical summaries usually are also produced.


## Graphs {#GraphOneQualOneQuant}
\index{Quantitative data!compare \textit{between} individuals!graphs}\index{Graphs!compare \textit{between} individuals}

When a *quantitative* variable is measured or observed in different groups (i.e., between individuals), the variables can be graphed within each group.
However, graphs for *comparing* the quantitative variable in the groups include: 

* [*Back-to-back stemplots*](#BackToBackStem):
  Best for small amounts of data in *two groups*; 
* [*2-D dot charts*](#TwoDDot): 
  Best choice for small to moderate amounts of data;
* [*Boxplots*](#Boxplot):
  Best choice, except for small amounts of data.        

These situations have *one quantitative variable* being compared in different groups (defined by *one qualitative variable*). 


### Back-to-back stemplot {#BackToBackStem}
\index{Stemplot!back-to-back}\index{Graphs!back-to-back stemplot}

Back-to-back stemplots are two stemplots (Sect.\ \@ref(StemAndLeafPlots)) sharing the same stems; one group has the leaves emerging left-to-right from the stem, and the second group has the leaves emerging right-to-left from the stem.
Back-to-back stemplots can only be used when *two* groups are being compared.
Again, one advantage of using stemplots over other plots is that the original data are retained.
One disadvantage is that only two groups can be compared.


::: {.example #GorillaData name="Back-to-back stemplots"}
A study recorded the number chest-beats by gorillas [@wright2021chest], for gorillas under $20$ years old ('younger') and $20$ years and over ('older')
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:GorillaDataTable)).'
} else {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:GorillaDataTableHTML)).'
}`
A back-to-back stemplot allows the two groups to be compared visually 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:krillEggsDoubleStem)).'
} else {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:krillEggsDoubleStemHTML)).'
}`
The leaves for younger gorillas go from right-to-left, and the leaves for older gorillas go left-to-right, sharing the same stems.
The younger group has a faster chest-beating rate in general.
One older gorilla has a much faster rate that the other older gorillas (an outlier).

### 2-D dot charts {#TwoDDot}
\index{Dot charts!comparing quantitative data}\index{Graphs!dot charts 2D}

A 2-dimensional (2-D) dot chart places a dot for each observation, separated for each level of the qualitative variable (also see Sect.\ \@ref(DotChartsOneQual)).
Any number of groups can be compared.


:::{.example #Dotchart2DGorillas name="Boxplots"}
For the chest-beating data seen in Example\ \@ref(exm:GorillaData), a dot chart is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TwoDDotchart).
Many observations are the same, so some points would be *over-plotted* if points were not *stacked* (left panel), or some randomness added in the vertical direction (a 'jitter'), before plotting (right panel).
:::

### Boxplots {#Boxplot}
\index{Boxplot}\index{Graphs!boxplot}

A boxplot is a picture of the quantiles (Sect.\ \@ref(VariationIQR)).
Any number of groups can be compared using a boxplot.

The distribution for each group is summarised by five numbers: the minimum value; $Q_1$; the median ($Q_2$); $Q_3$; and the maximum value.
Outliers, identified using the IQR rule (Sect. \@ref(OutliersIQRrule)), are also shown.
Distributions can be compared by comparing the values of $Q_1$, the medians, and the values of $Q_3$.
Since each distribution is summarised by just five numbers, a lot of detail of the distribution is lost.
Different software may use different rules for computing quartiles, and hence may produce slightly different boxplots.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Boxplots summarise data with only five numbers, so detail of the distributions are lost.
For this reason, boxplots are excellent for *comparing* distributions, but histograms are better for displaying the distribution of a single quantitative variable.
:::


:::{.example #BoxplotGorillas name="Boxplots"}
An example of a boxplot, for the chest-beating data in Example\ \@ref(exm:GorillaData), is shown in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BoxplotGorillas).
No outliers are identified for younger gorillas; one large outlier is identified for the older gorillas.
The boxplot shows a distinct difference between the chest-beating rates of older and younger gorillas.
:::

```{r BoxplotGorillas, fig.cap="A boxplot for the chest-beating data", fig.align="center",  fig.height=3, , fig.width=4.5, out.width='50%'}
CBR.C2 <- CBRolder[ -which.max(CBRolder)]

par( mar = c(4.5, 5, 4, 2) + 0.1 )
Gorillas$Age20 <- ordered(Gorillas$Age20,
                          levels = c("Younger", 
                                     "Older"))
out <- boxplot( ChestBeatRate ~ Age20,
         data = Gorillas,
         col = plot.colour,
         las = 1,
         pch = 19,
         ylim = c(0, 4.5),
         xlab = "Age group",
         ylab = "Chest-beating rate\n (per 110 h)",
         main = "Chest-beating rate\nof gorillas")

CBRyounger.quantiles <- out$stats[, 1]

```


The boxplots are explained in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BoxplotGorillasExplain).
Boxplots have five horizontal lines; from the top to the bottom of the plot.
First focus on just the boxplot for the *younger* gorillas (i.e., the left box):\index{Quartiles}

1. *Top line*:
   The *fastest* chest-beating rate is $`r CBRyounger.quantiles[5]`$ per $10$\ h.
2. *Second line from top*:
   $75$% of observations are smaller than about $`r CBRyounger.quantiles[4]`$, represented by the line at the top of the central box. 
   This is the *third quartile* ($Q_3$).
3. *Middle line*:
   $50$% of observations are smaller than about $`r CBRyounger.quantiles[3]`$, represented by the line inside the central box. 
   This is an 'average' value, the *second quartile* ($Q_2$).
4. *Second line from bottom*:
   $25$% of observations are smaller than about $`r CBRyounger.quantiles[2]`$, represented by the line at the bottom of the central box. 
   This is the *first quartile* ($Q_1$).
5. *Bottom line*:
   The *slowest* chest-beating rate is $`r CBRyounger.quantiles[1]`$ per $10$\ h. 




```{r BoxplotGorillasExplain, fig.cap="Explaining the boxplots for the chest-beating data", fig.align="center",  fig.height=4.25, , fig.width=10.5, out.width='100%'}

source("R/showExplainBoxplots.R")
```


The box for the *older* gorillas is slightly different (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BoxplotGorillas)): one observation is identified with a point, *above* the top line.
Computer software has identified this observation as a potentially *outlier* (in this case, unusually *large*), and has plotted this point separately, using the IQR rule (Sect.\ \@ref(OutliersIQRrule)).


```{r}
outC <- boxplot( list(Older = CBRolder),
                 plot = FALSE)
CBR.quantiles <- outC$stats
```

The values of $Q_1$, the median and $Q_3$ are all substantially larger for the younger gorillas, suggesting that younger gorillas have, in general, faster chest-beating rates.


::: {.example #BoxplotsHorizontal name="Boxplots"}
Boxplots can be plotted horizontally too, which leaves space for long labels.
In Fig.\ \@ref(fig:CementBuildBoxplot) (based on @data:Silva2016:rootcanal), the three dental cements are very different regarding their push-out forces.

## Summary tables {#CompareQuantTables}
\index{Quantitative data!compare \textit{between} individuals!summary tables}

The numerical summary information for comparing a quantitative between groups can be collated in a table.
The data should be summarised the quantitative variable for each group, and (when appropriate) the differences should also be summarised.

::: {.example #GorillaSummarytable name="Numerical summary table"}
For the gorilla data, the summary of the data can be tabulated as in Table\ \@ref(tab:GorillaTable).
Notice that no standard deviation or sample size is provided for the *difference*; these make no sense.

Based on the table, do you think a difference exists between the mean chest-beating rate for younger and older gorillas?
Remember, the data in Table\ \@ref(tab:GorillaTable) is for a *sample*, but the RQ is asking about the *population*.

## Example: water access {#WaterAccessCompareQuant}

A study of three rural communities in Cameroon [@lopez2022farmers] recorded data about access to water (Sect.\ \@ref(WaterAccessQuant)).
One of the main purposes of the study was to determine contributors to the incidence of diarrhea in young children ($85$ households had children under\ $5$).

The graphs (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:WaterAccessCompareQuantFigs)) and summary (Table\ \@ref(tab:WaterAccessCompareQuantTabs)) show that households in which diarrhea was found in the last two weeks in children had older coordinators, more people in the household, and more children under\ $5$ in the household. 
The may be expected: older female coordinators probably have more children, have more children in the household under\ $5$, and more children (and hence people) in the household in general.

## Chapter summary {#Chap14-Summary}
   
Quantitative data can be compared between different groups (between individuals comparisons) using a back-to-back stemplot, boxplot or $2$-D dot chart.
A summary table should show the numerical summaries for the quantitative variable at each comparison and, if appropriate, the between-group differences. 





## Quick review questions {#Chap14-QuickReview}

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}
Are the following statements *true* or *false*?

1. A boxplot is an appropriate graph for comparing a quantitative variable in two *or more* groups. \tightlist
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer = TRUE)}`
2. A back-to-back stemplot is an appropriate graph for comparing a quantitative variable in two *or more* groups.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer = FALSE)}`
3. A case-profile plot is an appropriate graph for comparing a quantitative variable in two *or more* groups.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {torf(answer = FALSE)}`
4. When comparing a quantitative variable in two *or more* groups, the sample size for the difference should be included

[*Dataset*: `AISsub`]
A study of athletes at the *Australian Institute of Sport* (AIS) measured numerous physical and blood measurements from high performance athletes [@data:Telford1991:sexsportsize].
The graph in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:AISfemalesportEng) (right panel) compares the heights of females in two similar sports: basketball and netball.

::: {.exercise #CompareQuantDeceleration}
[*Dataset*: `Deceleration`]
To reduce vehicle speeds on freeway exit ramps, a Chinese study studied using additional signage [@ma2019impacts].
At one site (Ningxuan Freeway), speeds were recorded at various points on the freeway exit for $38$ vehicles before the extra signage was added, and then for $41$ vehicles after the extra signage was added.

From this data, the *deceleration* of each vehicle was determined
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:SignageSummaryData))'
} else {
   '(data below)'
}`
as the vehicle left the $120$\ km/h speed zone and approached the $80$\ km/hr speed zone. 
Use the data, and the summary in Table\ \@ref(tab:SignageSummaryDec), to address this RQ:

> At this freeway exit, what is the difference between the mean vehicle deceleration, comparing the times before the extra signage is added and after extra signage is added?

In this context, the researchers are hoping that the extra signage might cause cars to slow down *faster* (i.e., they will decelerate more, on average, after adding the extra signage).

1. Construct a numerical summary table for the data.
2. Use software to construct a boxplot of the data.

[*Dataset*: `Typing`]
The `Typing` dataset contains information about the typing speed and accuracy for students, from an online typing test.
The four variables include are: typing speed (`mTS`), typing accuracy (`mAcc`), age (`Age`), and sex (`Sex`) for $1301$ students.

1. Produce appropriate numerical summaries for the quantitative variables.
1. Produce appropriate numerical summaries for *comparing* the quantitative variables for different values of the qualitative variable.
1. What do you learn from these numerical summaries?
