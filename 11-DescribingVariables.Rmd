## Introduction {#Describing-Intro}

Understanding the *type* of data collected is essential before starting any analysis, because the *type* of data determines how to proceed with summaries and analyses.
Broadly, data may be classified as either *quantitative* data (Sect.\ \@ref(QuantData)) or *qualitative* data (Sect.\ \@ref(QualData)).
The *data* are the recorded *values* of the variables, so sometimes we talk about quantitative and qualitative *variables*.
Recall that a variable is a single aspect or characteristic associated with the individuals, whose values can vary from individual to individual (Def.\ \@ref(def:Variable)).
Quantitative variables record quantitative data; qualitative variables record qualitative data.


::: {.example #VariablesData name="Variables and data"}
'Age' is a *variable* because age varies from individual to individual.
The *data* includes values like $13$ months, $21$ years and $76$ years.
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
*Quantitative research* summarises and analyses data using numerical methods (Sect.\ \@ref(TypesOfResearch)).
*Quantitative research* uses both *qualitative* and *quantitative* and variables, because both can be summarised numerically (Chaps.\ \@ref(SummariseQualData) and\ \@ref(SummariseQuantData) respectively) and analysed numerically.
:::


## Quantitative data: discrete and continuous data {#QuantData}

*Quantitative* data are *mathematically* numerical.
Most data arising from counting or measuring is quantitative. 
Quantitative data are often (but not always) measured with measurement units (such as *kg* or *cm*).
Be careful: Numerical data are not necessarily quantitative.
Only *mathematically numerical data are quantitative*; that is, numbers with numerical *meanings*.

</div>


::: {.definition #QuantitativeData name="Quantitative data"}
*Quantitative data* is *mathematically* numerical: the numbers have numerical meaning, and represent quantities or amounts.
Quantitative data generally arise from counting or measuring.

</div>


::: {.example #QuantitativePostcodes name="Quantitative data"}
The weight of numbats, the thickness of sheet metal, and blood pressure are all measured, and are quantitative variables.

The number of power failures per year, the number of solar panels per home, and the number of tangelos per tree are all counts, and are quantitative variables. 

Australian postcodes are four-digit numbers, but are *not* quantitative; the numbers are labels.
A postcode of 4556 isn't one 'better' or 'more' than a postcode of 4555.
The values do not have numerical *meanings*.
Indeed, alphabetic postcodes could have been chosen.
For example, the postcode of Caboolture is 4510, but could have been QCAB.
:::


Quantitative data may be further classified as *discrete* or *continuous*.
*Discrete* quantitative data has possible values that can be counted, at least in theory.
Sometimes, the possible values may have no theoretical upper limit, yet are still considered 'countable'.
*Continuous* quantitative data has values that cannot, at least in theory, be recorded exactly: another value can always be found between any two given values of the variable, if we measure to a greater number of decimal places.
In practice, though, values must be rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places.


::: {.definition #DiscreteData name="Discrete data"}
*Discrete* quantitative data has a countable number of possible values between any two given values of the variable.
:::


::: {.example #QuantDiscrete name="Discrete quantitative data"}
These quantitative variables are *discrete*:

* The *number* of heart attacks in the previous year experienced by Croatian women over $40$.
  Possible values: $0$, $1$, $2$, ...
* The *number* of cracked eggs in a carton of $12$.
  Possible values: $0$, $1$, $2$, ... $12$.
* The *number* of orthotic devices a person has used.
  Possible values: $0$, $1$, $2$, ... 
* The *number* of turbine cracks after $750$ hours use.
  Possible values: $0$, $1$, $2$, ...
:::



::: {.definition #ContinuousData name="Continuous data"}
*Continuous* quantitative data have (at least in theory) an infinite number of possible values between any two given values.
:::

Height is continuous: between the heights of $179$\ cm and $180$\ cm, many heights exist, depending on how many decimal places are used  to record height.
In practice, however, heights are usually rounded to the nearest centimetre for convenience.
All continuous data are rounded.


::: {.example #QuantContinuous name="Continuous quantitative data"}
These quantitative variables are *continuous*:

* The *weight* of $6$-year-old Fijian children.
  Values exist between any two given values of weight, by measuring to more decimal places of a kilogram.
  However, weights are usually reported to the nearest kilogram.
* The *energy consumption* of houses in London.
  Values exist between any two given values of energy consumption, by measuring to more and more decimal places of a kiloWatt-hour (kWh).
  Consumption would usually be given to the nearest kWh.
* The *time* spent in front of a computer each day for employees in a given industry.
  Values exist between any two given times, by measuring to more decimal places of a second.
  The values may be reported to the nearest minute, or the nearest $15$\ mins.
:::


Sometimes, discrete quantitative data with a very large number of possible values may be treated as continuous.


:::{.example #DiscreteAsContinuous name="Treating discrete data as continuous"}
Annual income is discrete, since no income is between \$$80\,000.00$ and \$$80\,000.01$.
However, annual incomes are usually much larger than cents, and vary at scales much greater than cents, and so are usually treated as continuous.
:::


## Qualitative data: nominal and ordinal data {#QualData}

*Qualitative* data has distinct labels or categories, and are not mathematically numerical.
Be careful: *numerical* data may be qualitative if those numbers don't have numerical *meanings*.
The categories of a qualitative variable are called the *levels* or the *values* of the variable.

      
<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-construction-35-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


::: {.definition #QualitativeData name="Qualitative data"}
*Qualitative data* is not *mathematically* numerical data: it consists of categories or labels. 
:::


::: {.definition #Levels name="Levels"}
The *levels* (or the *values*) of a qualitative variable refer to the names of the distinct categories. 
:::


::: {.example #DefinitionsClarity name="Clarity in variables"}
'Age' is a *continuous quantitative* variable, since age could be measured to many decimal places of a second.
Age is usually rounded down to the number of completed years, for convenience.
However, the age of young children may be given as '$3$ days' or '$10$ months'.

Sometimes *Age group* is used (such as Under $20$; $20$ to under $50$; $50$ or over) instead of Age.
'Age group' is *qualitative*.

Ensure you are clear about which is used!
:::
	

::: {.example #QualData name="Qualitative data"}
'Brand of mobile phone' is qualitative.
Many levels (i.e., brands) are possible, but could be simplified by using the levels as 'Apple', 'Samsung', 'Google' and 'Other'.
:::


      
::: {.example #QualData2 name="Qualitative data"}
Australian postcodes are numbers, but are *qualitative* (Example\ \@ref(exm:QuantitativePostcodes)).
:::


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
Consider these two qualitative variables.
What features of the data collected from the two questions are similar? 
What features are different?
\vspace{-2ex}

1. *Blood type*, with levels: Type\ A; Type\ B; Type\ AB; Type\ O.
2. *Age group*, with levels: Under $20$; $20$ to under $50$; $50$ or over.
:::


Qualitative data can be further classified as *nominal* or *ordinal*.
*Nominal* variables are qualitative variables where the levels *have no natural order*.
*Ordinal* variables are qualitative variables where the levels *do have a natural order*.
In the question above, 'Blood type' is qualitative *nominal*,  while 'Age group' is qualitative *ordinal*.


::: {.definition #Nominal name="Nominal qualitative variables"}
A *nominal* qualitative variable is a qualitative variable where the levels *do not* have a natural order. 
:::


::: {.definition #Ordinal name="Ordinal qualitative variables"}
An *ordinal* qualitative variable is a qualitative variable where the levels *do* have a natural order. 
:::


::: {.example #NominalData name="Nominal data"}
The variable 'How students get to university' is *nominal*; the levels may be: Car (driver or passenger); Bus; Ride bicycle; Walk; Other.

The data are *nominal* with five levels.
The levels can appear in any order: from largest group to smallest, or in alphabetical order.
Since there is no *natural* order, the order used should be carefully considered: what is the most useful order when summarising the data?
:::



::: {.example #OrdinalData name="Ordinal data"}
A questionnaire question where respondents are asked to select from options like 
Strongly disagree; Disagree; Neither agree or disagree; Agree; Strongly agree.
will produce *ordinal* data.

For example, the responses to the following question will be *ordinal* with five levels:

> Please indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with this statement:
> 'Vaping should be banned'.

Giving the levels in the given order (or the reverse order) makes sense; giving the levels in alphabetical order, for example, would not make sense.

::: {.example #TypesVariables name="Types of variables"}
Consider a study to determine if the weight of $500$\ g bags of pasta really weigh $500$\ g (or more).
One approach is to record the weight of pasta in each bag (a *quantitative* variable), and compare the *average* weight to the target weight of $500$\ g.

Another approach is to record whether each bag of pasta was underweight or not (using a balance scale).
This variable would be *qualitative*, with two *levels* (underweight; not underweight).
The *percentage* of underweight bags could be reported.

::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
Most statistical software packages, like jamovi, require the user to describe the variables.
This enables the software to produce appropriate output and suggest appropriate analyses.

## Chapter summary {#Describing-Summary}

The *type* of data collected determines the types of summaries and analyses that are needed.
Data and variables can be classified as either:

* *quantitative* (*discrete* or *continuous*) if they are mathematically numerical; or
* *qualitative* (*nominal* or *ordinal*) if they are not mathematically numerical.


## Quick revision questions {#Chap11-QuickReview}

::: {.webex-check .webex-box}
A study on the bruising of apples [@doosti2016development] explored the relationship between the surface temperature of apples, and the depth of bruising.

The researchers purposefully hit apples with three different *forces* ($200$, $700$ and $1200$\ mJ) to inflict bruises.
This was repeated at three different *locations* of the apple (lower; middle; upper).
The researchers then recorded the *depth* of the bruising, and the *surface temperature* (in ^o^C) at each bruise location.

1. How would the variable 'location on the apple' be best classified using the language of this chapter?\tightlist
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {longmcq( c(
	"Qualitative nominal",
	answer = "Qualitative ordinal",
	"Quantitative discrete",
	"Quantitative continuous"))}`

1. The variable 'force of hit' could be classified as quantitative continuous variable.
   However, since only a small number of forces are used, it should probably be classified as qualitative ordinal.
   How many *levels* would the variable have?

	answer = "Three levels: 200, 700 and 1200 mJ",
	"Four levels: four variables are listed in the study",
