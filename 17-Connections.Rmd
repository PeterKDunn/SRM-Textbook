# Summarising connections between two quantitative variables

## Graphs

Scatterplots display the relationship between *two quantitative variables*.
Conventionally, when appropriate, the response variable is on the vertical axis, and the explanatory variable is on the horizontal axis.
As with any graph, describing the message in the graph is important, because the purpose of a graph is to display the information in the clearest, simplest possible way.
*Scatterplots* can be described by briefly explaining how the variables are related to each other.
Scatterplots are studied further in Sect.\ \@ref(Scatterplots).

::: {.example #Scatterplots2 name="Scatterplots"}
A study of athletes at the *Australian Institute of Sport* (AIS) measured numerous physical and blood measurements from high performance athletes [@data:Telford1991:sexsportsize].
Many relationships were of interest; Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ScatterAIS) shows the relationship between the sum of skin folds (SSF) and percentage body fat.
Each point represents the percentage body fat and the SSF for one athlete.
Clearly, the greater the percentage body fat, the greater the sum of skin folds, in general.

```{r ScatterAIS, results ='hide', fig.cap="Scatterplot of SSF against percentage body fat for male AIS athletes", fig.width=4.5, fig.height=3.75, fig.align="center", out.width='50%'}
data(AISsub)

plot( SSF ~ PBF,
      data = AISsub,
      las = 1,
      xlim = c(5, 20),
      ylim = c(20, 120),
      main = "SSF vs PBF: Male AIS athletes",
      xlab = "Percentage body fat",
      ylab = "Sum of skin fold",
      pch = 19)
title(sub = "(Note: Units of measurement for SSF not given)", 
      cex.sub = 0.85)
```




## Summary tables {#ConnectionSummaryTables}

The numerical summary information the relationship between *two quantitative variables* can be collated in a table.
The data should be summarised each variable.


```{r AISTable}
AISTable <- array( dim = c(2, 3))

rownames(AISTable) <- c("Sum of skin fold",
                        "Percentage body fat") 
colnames(AISTable) <- c("Mean",
                        "Std. dev.",
                        "Sample size") 


AISTable[, 1] <- round(colMeans(AISsub[, 2:3]), 1)
AISTable[, 2] <- round(apply(AISsub[, 2:3], 2, "sd"), 2)
AISTable[, 3] <- round(apply(AISsub[, 2:3], 2, "realLength"), 0)

knitr::kable( pad(AISTable,
                  surroundMaths = TRUE,
                  targetLength = c(4, 5, 3),
                  digits = c(1, 2, 0)),
              format = "latex",
              longtable = FALSE,
              booktabs = TRUE,
              escape = FALSE,
              digits = 1,
              align = "c",
              caption = "A numerical summary of the AIS dataUNITS!!!!!") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(row = 0, 
           bold = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(row = 3,
           italic = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10)
```
