## General ideas {#SampleSizeIdeas}

A [confidence interval](#AboutCIs) is an interval which gives a range of values of the population parameter that could plausibly have given rise to our observed value of the statistic.
All other things being equal, a *larger* sample size gives a *more precise* estimate of the population parameter.
After all, that's why we prefer larger samples: to get more [*precise*](#PrecisionAccuracy) estimates, and hence narrower CIs.
If that was not the case, we could take the smallest, cheapest and easiest possible sample of size one... which is clearly absurd.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Remember that the sample size is the number of [*units of analysis*](#UnitsObsAnalysis).
:::


If larger samples give more precise estimates, should we use the largest sample possible?
Not necessarily: using large samples also has disadvantages: 

* Studies with larger samples take longer to conduct.
* Studies with larger samples can cost more money.
* Ethics committees often wish to keep sample sizes as small as possible, so that:
  - As little (potential) harm as possible is done to the environment.
  - As little (potential) harm as possible is done to as few animals as possible. 
  - As little (potential) harm as possible is done to as few people as possible. 
  - Resources, time and money are not wasted.

Determining the sample size to use is a trade-off between cost, time, ethics and precision. 


::: {.example #Biochar}
Consider a project studying the residual effect of organic biochar compound fertilizers (BCFs) *two years* after application [@farrar2021biochar].
This study requires planting turmeric in pots using soil previously treated with BCFs.

After the turmeric was grown, the concentration of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen---as well as many trace minerals---was determined from the soil in *every* pot.
In addition, *every* turmeric plant was analysed for the number of shoots, the leaf mass fraction, and foliar nutrient information.

Clearly, every pot that is used comes with a substantial cost, both in terms of time and money.

In this chapter, we learn how to compute the (approximate) minimum sample size needed to obtain a given precision for a confidence interval.
We only study estimating sample sizes for descriptive RQs:

* Estimating sample size for estimating a proportion: Sect \@ref(SampleSizeProportions).
* Estimating sample size for estimating a mean: Sect \@ref(SampleSizeOneMean).
* Estimating sample size for estimating a mean difference: Sect \@ref(SampleSizeMeanDifferences).

## One proportion {#SampleSizeProportions}

For a given level of confidence, the width of a CI depends on the size of the sample.
All other things being equal, *larger* samples produce more [*precise*](#PrecisionAccuracy) estimates of the parameter (Sect.&nbsp;\@ref(PrecisionAccuracy)), and hence *narrower* CIs.



```{r, child = if (knitr::is_html_output())  './children/HTML/SampleSizeCI.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = if (knitr::is_latex_output()) './children/LaTeX/SampleSizeCI.Rmd'}
```

In other words, improving precision gets more difficult as sample sizes get larger.
Large gains in precision are made by moderately increasing small sample sizes, but only small gains in precision are made by large increases in already-large sample sizes. 

For the NHANES data, first seen in Sect.&nbsp;\@ref(NHANESGraphs), the unknown parameter is $p$, the *population* proportion of Americans that currently smoke.
In the study, 1466 out of the 3211 respondents who reported their smoking status said they currently smoked: $\hat{p} =  1466\div 3211 = 0.4566$ where $n = 1466$.
The standard  error is $\text{s.e.}(\hat{p}) = 0.00879$, so the approximate 95% CI for $p$ is $0.456\pm 0.018$, or from 0.439 to 0.474.

Suppose we want our 95% CI for the proportion of smokers to be precise to give-or-take $0.01$ (that is, $\pm 0.01$, rather than the $\pm 0.018$ found from the sample).
What size sample is needed?
Since we seek a *more* precise estimate, a *larger* sample is needed... but how much larger?


:::{.definition #SampleSizeProportion name="Sample size (proportion)"}
Conservatively, the size of the [*simple random sample*](#SRS) needed *for a 95% CI for a proportion* with a specified margin-of error is *at least*

\[
   \frac{1}{(\text{Margin of error})^2}.
\]
We say "conservatively", since the sample may be a little too large, but that's better than being too small.
:::

For the NHANES example, then, a sample size of at least $\displaystyle 1\div (0.01^2) = 10\,000$ Americans is needed.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Always **round up** the result of the sample size calculation.
:::



::: {.example #SampleSizep name="Sample size calculations for one proportion"}
To estimate the population proportion of Australians that smoke, to within $0.07$ with 95% confidence, a sample size of at least
   
\[
  \frac{1}{(\text{Margin of error})^2} { = \frac{1}{0.07^2}}
\]
is needed; *at least* $n = 204.0816$ people.

In practice, *at least* 205 people are needed to achieve this desired level of precision (that is, **always round up** in sample size calculations).

## One mean {#SampleSizeOneMean}

As with proportions, estimating a population *mean* is more *precise* with a larger sample.
All other things being equal, *larger* samples produce more [*precise*](#PrecisionAccuracy) estimates of the parameter (Sect.&nbsp;\@ref(PrecisionAccuracy)), and hence *narrower* CIs (Fig. \@ref(fig:SampleSizeCIWidthMean)).
Again, large gains in precision are made by moderately increasing small sample sizes, but only small gains in precision are made by large increases in already-large sample sizes.

:::{.definition #SampleSizeMean name="Sample size (mean)"}
Conservatively, the size of the [*simple random sample*](#SRS) needed *for a 95% CI for the mean* with a specified margin-of error is *at least*

\[
   \left( \frac{2 \times s}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2.
\]
We say "conservatively", since the sample may be a little too large, but that's better than being too small.
:::



Notice that the formula requires an estimate of the population standard deviation (that is, the sample standard deviation, $s$).
But if we don't have a sample yet... how can we have a value for the *sample* standard deviation?
Sometimes, an approximate value for $s$ comes from:

* The results of a [pilot study](#protocols), where the computed value of $s$ is used.
* The results of a similar study, where the value $s$ found there can be used (see Example \@ref(exm:SampleSizePeanuts)).

::: {.example #SampleSizePeanuts name="Sample size estimation for one mean"}
Sect. \@ref(Cadmium-In-Peanuts) discusses a study about the mean cadmium concentrations in peanuts in the United States, where $s = 0.0460$&nbsp;ppm.

Suppose we wanted to estimate the mean cadmium concentration in *Australian* peanuts, to give-or-take $0.005$&nbsp;ppm with 95% confidence.
We could use this value for $s$ as a starting point, and then compute:

\[
   \left( \frac{2 \times 0.0460}{0.005}\right)^2 = 338.56;
\] 
we would need about 339 peanuts.
:::



## Mean differences {#SampleSizeMeanDifferences}

The ideas in the previous section also work for computing sample sizes for estimating *mean differences*, since the differences can be treated like a single sample.
Conservatively, the size of the [*simple random sample*](#SRS) needed **for a 95% CI** is *at least*  
\[
   \left( \frac{2 \times s_d}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2.
\]


```{r}
data(Diabetes)

Diabetes$Diff <- Diabetes$SBPfirst - Diabetes$SBPsecond

n.D.diff <- length( Diabetes$Diff ) - sum( is.na(Diabetes$Diff) )
se.D.diff <- sd(Diabetes$Diff, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n.D.diff)


ci.lo <- mean(Diabetes$Diff) - 2 * se.D.diff
ci.hi <-  mean(Diabetes$Diff) + 2 * se.D.diff
```


::: {.example #SampleSizeDBPReduction name="Sample size estimation for mean differences"}
In Sect. \@ref(BloodPressure), the mean *reduction* in diastolic blood pressure from the first to the second visit to a clinic was estimated [@data:Willems1997:CHD; @data:Schorling1997:smoking], using a sample of size $n = `r n.D.diff`$.
The computed approximate 95% CI was $`r round( mean(Diabetes$Diff, na.rm=TRUE), 3)`$, give-or-take $`r round(2 * se.D.diff, 3)`$, and the standard deviation *of the differences* was $s_d = `r round(sd(Diabetes$Diff, na.rm = TRUE), 3)`$.

Suppose we wanted the 95% CI to have a margin of error of only $1.00$ (that is, rather than $`r round(2 * se.D.diff, 3)`$), the size sample needed would be  
\[
      \left( \frac{2 \times s_d}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{2 \times 10.931
 }{1.00}\right)^2 = 477.947;
\]
we would need about 478 patients (recall we always *round up* in sample size calculations).
:::



## Other issues related to sample size {#SampleSizeOtherIssues}

The above calculations form just one part of the information needed to make the final decision about the necessary sample size.
For example, the *cost* (time and money) of taking sample of this size has not been factored in.

The calculations in this chapter assume a [*simple random sample*](#SRS) will be used, which is often unreasonable.
Other, more complex, formulas are available for computing sample sizes for other random-sampling schemes (such as [stratified samples](#StratifiedSampling)).
However, 
the above calculations do give an *estimate* of the sample size that would be required.
In addition, the calculations in this chapter are only for producing 95% confidence intervals. 

In practice, researchers often start with a slightly larger sample than required to allow for drop-outs (for example, plants die, or people withdraw from the study).



## Example: paramedics

@data:MacDonald:Resuscitation studied the time taken for paramedics to perform certain tasks (such as intravenous cannulation and electrical defibrillation).
To compute the necessary sample size, they used a standard deviation of 0.2 minutes (based on data from previous similar studies) with a margin of error of 0.1 minutes (with 95% confidence).
The necessary sample size is

\[
   n = \left( \frac{2 \times s}
                   {\text{Margin of error}}
       \right)^2 
       = \left(\frac{2 \times 0.2}
              {0.1}
         \right)^2 
       = 16.
\]
A sample size of 16 paramedics was required (and was used).
