## Estimating sample size: General ideas {#SampleSizeIdeas}

A [confidence interval](#AboutCIs) is an interval which gives a range of values of the population parameter that could plausibly have given rise to our observed value of the statistic.
All other things being equal, a *larger* sample size gives a *more precise* estimate of the population parameter.
After all, that's why we prefer larger samples: to get more [*precise*](#PrecisionAccuracy) estimates, and hence narrower CIs.
If that was not the case, we could take the smallest, cheapest and easiest possible sample of size one... which is clearly absurd.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Remember that the sample size is the number of [*units of analysis*](#UnitsObsAnalysis).
:::


If larger samples give more precise estimates, should we use the largest sample possible?
Using large samples also has disadvantages: 

* Studies with larger samples take longer to conduct.
* Studies with larger samples can cost more money.
* Ethics committees often wish to keep sample sizes as small as possible, so that:
  - As little (potential) harm as possible is done to the environment.
  - As little (potential) harm as possible is done to as few animals as possible. 
  - As little (potential) harm as possible is done to as few people as possible. 
  - Resources and time are not wasted.

Determining the sample size to use is a trade-off between cost, time, ethics and precision. 


::: {.example #Biochar}
Consider a project studying the residual effect of organic biochar compound fertilizers (BCFs) two years after application [@farrar2021biochar].
This study requires planting tumeric in pots using soil previously treated with BCFs.

After the turmeric was grown, the concentration of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen---as well as many trace minerals---was determined from the soil in *every* pot.
In addition, *every* turmeric plant was analysed for the number of shoots, the leaf mass fraction, and foliar nutrient information.

Clearly, every pot that is used comes with a substantial cost, both in terms of time and money.

In this chapter, we learn how to compute the (approximate) minimum sample size needed to obtain a given precision for a confidence interval.

## Estimating sample sizes: one proportion

For a given level of confidence, the width of a CI depends on the size of the sample.
All other things being equal, *larger* samples produce more [*precise*](#PrecisionAccuracy) estimates of the parameter (Sect.&nbsp;\@ref(PrecisionAccuracy)), and hence *narrower* CIs.



```{r, child = if (knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"))  './children/HTML/SampleSizeCI.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = if (knitr::is_latex_output()) './children/LaTeX/SampleSizeCI.Rmd'}
```


Suppose we want our 95% CI for the proportion of smokers (Example \@ref(exm:NHANESSmokers)) to be precise to give-or-take $0.01$ (rather than the $\pm 0.018$ found from the sample).
What size sample is needed?

Since we seek a *more* precise estimate, a *larger* sample is needed... but how much larger?
Conservatively, the size of the [*simple random sample*](#SRS) needed **for a 95% CI** is *at least*

\[
   \frac{1}{(\text{Margin of error})^2}.
\]
That is, a sample size of at least  $\displaystyle \frac{1}{0.01^2} = 10\,000$  Americans is needed.


::: {.example #SampleSizep name="Sample size calculations for one proportion"}
To estimate the population proportion of Australians that smoke, to within $0.07$ with 95% confidence, a sample size of at least
   
\[
  \frac{1}{(\text{Margin of error})^2} { = \frac{1}{0.07^2}}
\]
is needed; *at least* $n = 204.0816$ people.

In practice, *at least* 205 people are needed to achieve this desired level of precision (that is, **always round up** in sample size calculations).

## Estimating sample sizes: one mean {#SampleSizeOneMean}

As with proportions, estimating a population *mean* is more *precise* with a larger sample.
All other things being equal, *larger* samples produce more [*precise*](#PrecisionAccuracy) estimates of the parameter (Sect.&nbsp;\@ref(PrecisionAccuracy)), and hence *narrower* CIs.

Conservatively, the size of the [*simple random sample*](#SRS) needed **for a 95% CI** is *at least*

\[
   \left( \frac{2 \times s}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2.
\]

Notice that the formula requires an estimate of the population standard deviation (that is, the sample standard deviation, $s$).
But if we don't have a sample yet... how can we have a value for the *sample* standard deviation?
Sometimes, an approximate value for $s$ comes from:

* The results of a [pilot study](#protocols), where the computed value of $s$ is used.
* The results of a similar study, where the value $s$ found there can be used (see Example \@ref(exm:SampleSizePeanuts)).

::: {.example #SampleSizePeanuts name="Sample size estimation for one mean"}
Sect. \@ref(Cadmium-In-Peanuts) discusses a study about the mean cadmium concentrations in peanuts in the United States, where $s = 0.0460$&nbsp;ppm.

Suppose we wanted to estimate the mean cadmium concentration in *Australian* peanuts, to give-or-take $0.005$&nbsp;ppm with 95% confidence.
We could use this value for $s$ as a starting point, and then compute:

\[
   \left( \frac{2 \times 0.0460}{0.005}\right)^2 = 338.56;
\] 
we would need about 339 peanuts.

## Estimating sample sizes: one mean {#SampleSizeOneMean}

The ideas in the previous section also work for computing sample sizes for estimating *mean differences*, since the differences can be treated like a single sample.
Conservatively, the size of the [*simple random sample*](#SRS) needed **for a 95% CI** is *at least*

\[
   \left( \frac{2 \times s_d}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2.
\]


```{r echo=FALSE}
diab <- read.csv("./Data/Diabetes.csv")

diab$Diff <- diab$bp.1d - diab$bp.2d

n.D.diff <- length( diab$Diff ) - sum( is.na(diab$Diff) )
se.D.diff <- sd(diab$Diff, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n.D.diff)

diab$Diff <- diab$bp.1d - diab$bp.2d
n.D.diff <- length( diab$Diff ) - sum( is.na(diab$Diff) )
se.D.diff <- sd(diab$Diff, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n.D.diff)

ci.lo <- mean(diab$Diff) - 2 * se.D.diff
ci.hi <-  mean(diab$Diff) + 2 * se.D.diff
```


::: {.example #SampleSizeDBPReduction name="Sample size estimation for mean differences"}
In Sect. \@ref(BloodPressure), the mean *reduction* in diastolic blood pressure from the first to the second visit to a clinic was estimated [@data:Willems1997:CHD; @data:Schorling1997:smoking], using a sample of size $n = `r n.D.diff`$.
The computed approximate 95% CI was $`r round( mean(diab$Diff, na.rm=TRUE), 3)`$, give-or-take $`r round(2 * se.D.diff, 3)`$, and the standard deviation *of the differences* was $s_d = `r round(sd(diab$Diff, na.rm = TRUE), 3)`$.

Suppose we wanted the 95% CI to have a margin of error of only $1.00$ (rather than $`r round(2 * se.D.diff, 3)`$), the size sample needed would be
\[
      \left( \frac{2 \times s_d}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2 = \left( \frac{2 \times 8.026}{1.00}\right)^2 = 257.66;
\]
we would need about 258 patients (recall we always *round up* in sample size calculations).

## Other issues related to sample size {#SampleSizeOtherIssues}

The above calculations form just one part of the information needed to make the final decision about the necessary sample size.
For example, the *cost* (time and money) of taking sample of this size has not been factored in.
In addition, this calculation assumes a [*simple random sample*](#SRS) will be used, which is often unreasonable.
Other, more complex, formulas are available for computing sample sizes for other random-sampling schemes (such as [stratified samples](#StratifiedSampling)).
However, 
the above calculations do give an *estimate* of the sample size that would be required.

In addition, starting with a slightly larger sample than required to allow for drop-outs (for example, plants die, or people withdraw from the study).



## Example: Paramedics

@data:MacDonald:Resuscitation studied the time taken for paramedics to perform certain tasks (such as intravenous cannulation and electrical defibrillation).
To compute the necessary sample size, they used a standard deviation of 0.2 minutes (based on data from previous similar studies) with a margin of error of 0.1 minutes (with 95% confidence).
The necessary sample size is

\[
   n = \left( \frac{2 \times s}
                   {\text{Margin of error}}
       \right)^2 
       = \left(\frac{2 \times 0.2}
              {0.1}
         \right)^2 
       = 16.
\]
A sample size of 16 paramedics was required (and used).

1. **FALSE**. The *size* of the sample, and *how* the sample was obtained, are two different issues.
1. **FALSE**. We also need to consider the cost (in terms of size and time) and ethical issues also.
