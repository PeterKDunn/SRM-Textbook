# Sample sizes for CIs {#EstimatingSampleSize}


::: {.objectivesBox .objectives data-latex="{iconmonstr-target-4-240.png}"}
So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have also been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals.

**In this chapter**, you will learn how to compute the size sample that is needed to produce a CI with a certain coverage.
You will learn to:

* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a **proportion**.
* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a **mean**.

## Estimating sample size: General ideas {#SampleSizeIdeas}

A [confidence interval](#AboutCIs) is an interval which gives a range of values of the population parameter that could plausibly have given rise to our observed value of the statistic.
All other things being equal, a *larger* sample size would give a more precise estimate. 
After all, that's why we would like larger samples: to get more [*precise*](#PrecisionAccuracy) estimates, and hence narrower CIs.
If that was not the case, we could take the smallest, cheapest and easiest possible sample of size one... which is clearly absurd.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Remember that the sample size is the number of [*units of analysis*](#UnitsObsAnalysis).
:::


If larger samples give better estimates, should we use the largest sample possible?
Using large samples also has disadvantages: 

* Studies with larger samples take longer to conduct.
* Studies with larger samples can cost more money.
* Ethics committees often wish to keep sample sizes as small as possible, so that:
  - As little (potential) harm as possible is done to the environment.
  - As little (potential) harm as possible is done to as few animals as possible. 
  - As little (potential) harm as possible is done to as few people as possible. 
  - Resources and time are not being wasted.

Determining what sample size to use is, therefore, a trade-off between cost, time, ethics and precision. 


::: {.example #Biochar}
Consider a project studying the residual effect of organic biochar compound fertilizers (BCFs) two years after application [@farrar2021biochar].
This study requires planting tumeric in pots using soil previously treated with BCFs.

After the turmeric was grown, the concentration of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen--as well as many trace minerals--was determined from the soil in *every* pot.
In addition, *every* turmeric plant was analysed for the number of shoots, the leaf mass fraction, and foliar nutrient information.

Clearly, every pot that is used comes with a substantial cost, both in terms of time and money.

In this chapter, we learn how to compute the (approximate) minimum sample size needed to obtain a given precision for a confidence interval.

## Estimating sample sizes: one proportion

For a given level of confidence, the width of a CI depends on the size of the sample.
All other things being equal, *larger* samples produce more [*precise*](#PrecisionAccuracy) estimates of the parameter (Sect.&nbsp;\@ref(PrecisionAccuracy)), and hence *narrower* CIs.



```{r, child = if (knitr::is_html_output(excludes = "epub"))  './children/HTML/SampleSizeCI.Rmd'}
```

```{r, child = if (knitr::is_latex_output()) './children/LaTeX/SampleSizeCI.Rmd'}
```


Suppose we want our 95% CI for the proportion of smokers (Example \@ref(exm:NHANESSmokers)) to be precise to give-or-take $0.01$ (rather than the $\pm 0.018$ found from the sample).
What size sample is needed?

Since we seek a *more* precise estimate, a *larger* sample is needed... but how much larger?
Conservatively, the size of the [*simple random sample*](#SRS) needed **for a 95% CI** is *at least*

\[
   \frac{1}{(\text{Margin of error})^2}.
\]
That is, a sample size of at least  $\displaystyle \frac{1}{0.01^2} = 10\,000$  Americans is needed.


::: {.example #SampleSizep name="Sample size calculations for one proportion"}
To estimate the population proportion of Australians that smoke, to within $0.07$ with 95% confidence, a sample size of at least
   
\[
  \frac{1}{(\text{Margin of error})^2} { = \frac{1}{0.07^2}}
\]
is needed; *at least* $n = 204.0816$ people.

In practice, *at least* 205 people are needed to achieve this desired level of precision (that is, **always round up** in sample size calculations).

## Estimating sample sizes: one mean {#SampleSizeOneMean}

As with proportions, estimating a population *mean* is more *precise* with a larger sample.
All other things being equal, *larger* samples produce more [*precise*](#PrecisionAccuracy) estimates of the parameter (Sect.&nbsp;\@ref(PrecisionAccuracy)), and hence *narrower* CIs.

Conservatively, the size of the [*simple random sample*](#SRS) needed **for a 95% CI** is *at least*

\[
   \left( \frac{2 \times s}{\text{Margin of error}}\right)^2.
\]

Notice that the formula requires an estimate of the population standard deviation (that is, the sample standard deviation, $s$).
But if we don't have a sample yet... how can we have a value for the *sample* standard deviation?
Sometimes, an approximate value for $s$ comes from:

* The results of a [pilot study](#protocols), where the computed value of $s$ is used.
* The results of a similar study, where the value $s$ found there can be used (see Example \@ref(exm:SampleSizePeanuts)).

::: {.example #SampleSizePeanuts name="Sample size estimation for one mean"}
Sect. \@ref(Cadmium-In-Peanuts) discusses a study about the mean cadmium concentrations in peanuts in the United States, where $s = 0.0460$&nbsp;ppm.

Suppose we wanted to estimate the mean cadmium concentration in *Australian* peanuts, to give-or-take $0.005$&nbsp;ppm with 95% confidence.
We could use this value for $s$ as a starting point, and then compute:

\[
   \left( \frac{2 \times 0.0460}{0.005}\right)^2 = 338.56;
\] 
we would need about 339 peanuts.

::: {.example #SampleSizepNHANES name="Sample size estimation (means)"}
What size sample is needed to estimate the direct HDL cholesterol levels for Australians, to within 0.02&nbsp;mmol/L, with 95% confidence?

In the absence of any better data, we could use the value for $s$ from the NHANES study, which studies Americans. 
The value of $s$ for Americans would likely to be reasonably similar to the value for Australians.
For this reason, we will use $s = 0.39926$ (from Sect. \@ref(OneMeanCINHANES)).

Also, since we would like to estimate the population mean give-or-take 0.02&nbsp;mmol/L, the 'margin of error'  is 0.02.
So, using $s = 0.39926$, the required sample size is *at least*
\[
   \left( \frac{2 \times 0.39926}{0.02}\right)^2 = 1594.085;
\] 
at least 1595 Australians are needed.
(Remember to always *round up* in sample size calculations.)

## Other issues related to sample size {#SampleSizeOtherIssues}

The above calculations form just one part of the information needed to make the final decision about the necessary sample size.
For example, the *cost* (time and money) of taking sample of this size has not been factored in.
In addition, this calculation assumes a [*simple random sample*](#SRS) will be used, which is often unreasonable.
Other, far more complex, formulas are available for computing sample sizes for other random-sampling schemes (such as [stratified samples](#StratifiedSampling)).
However, 
the above calculations do give an *estimate* of the sample size that would be required.


In addition, starting with a slightly larger sample than required to allow for drop-outs (for example, plants die, or people withdraw from the study).







::: {.example #SampleSizeParamed name="Sample size estimation (means)"}
@data:MacDonald:Resuscitation studied the time taken for paramedics to perform certain tasks (such as intravenous cannulation and electrical defibrillation).
To compute the necessary sample size, they used a standard deviation of 0.2 minutes (based on data from previous similar studies) with a margin of error of 0.1 minutes (with 95% confidence).
The necessary sample size is

\[
   n = \left( \frac{2 \times s}
                   {\text{Margin of error}}
       \right)^2 
       = \left(\frac{2 \times 0.2}
              {0.1}
         \right)^2 
       = 16.
\]
A sample size of 16 paramedics was required (and used).

1. **TRUE**. The reason why larger sample are "better" is that they estimate the unknown population parameter with greater precision.
1. **FALSE**. The *size* of the sample, and *how* the sample was obtained, are two different issues.
1. **FALSE**. We also need to consider the cost (in terms of size and time) and ethical issues also.
