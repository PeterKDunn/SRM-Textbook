On the tables (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TablesExampleLaTeX)), find $-2.4$ in the *left* margin of the table, and find the second decimal place (in this case, $3$) in the *top* margin of the table: where these intersect is the area (or probability) *less than* the $z$-score of $-2.43$.

The probability of finding a $z$-score less than $z = -2.43$ is $0.0075$, or about $0.75$\%.
