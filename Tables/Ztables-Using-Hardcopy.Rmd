The tables (Appendices \@ref(ZTablesNEG) and \@ref(ZTablesPOS)) work with $z$-scores to two decimal places, so consider the $z$-score as $z = -2.14$.
\medskip

On the tables, find $-2.1$ in the *left* margin of the table, and find the second decimal place (in this case, $4$) in the top margin of the table (see the image on the right): where these intersect is the area (or probability) *less than* the $z$-score.
\medskip 

The probability of finding a $z$-score less than $z = -2.14$ is $0.0162$, or about $1.62$\%.

The tables always give the area to the **left** of the $z$-score that is looked up.
