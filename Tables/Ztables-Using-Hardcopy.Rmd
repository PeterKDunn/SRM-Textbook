Using Appendix\ \@ref(ZTablesNEG), find $-2.4$ in the *left* margin of the table (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TablesExampleLaTeX)), and find the second decimal place (in this case, $3$) in the *top* margin of the table: where these intersect is the area (or probability) *less than* the $z$-score of $-2.43$; that is, the probability of finding a $z$-score less than $z = -2.43$ is $0.0075$, or about $0.75$\%.

```{r TablesExampleLaTeX, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Using the $z$-score tables; when $z = -2.43$, the area to the left is $0.0075$.", out.width='50%'}
