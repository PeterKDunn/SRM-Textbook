### Using these tables {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Details for using these tables are provided in Sect.\ \@ref(ExactAreasUsingTables).
Here we give a short summary.

To find the probability that\ $z$ is less than $-2.43$, follow these steps:

1. Use Appendix\ \@ref(ZTablesNEG) to find $-2.4$ in the *left* margin of the table (see image below).
2. Then, find the second decimal place (in this case, $3$) in the *top* margin of the table.
3. Where these intersect is the area (or probability) *less than* the $z$-score of $-2.43$.

The probability of finding a $z$-score less than $z = -2.43$ is $0.0075$, or about $0.75$\%.
