When the $z$-scores (in the *margins* of the tables in Appendices \@ref(ZTablesNEG) and \@ref(ZTablesPOS)) were known, the *areas* were found in the *body* of the table.
If the area, or probability (in the *body* of the table) is known, the corresponding $z$-score can be found (in the *margins* of the table).
Using the hard copy tables (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:TablesExampleLaTeXBackwards)), locate the area of $0.0300$ (or as close as possible) in the *body* of the table, then read the $z$-score from the margins of the table.


```{r TablesExampleLaTeXBackwards, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%', fig.cap="Using the $z$-tables backwards; when $z = -1.88$, the area to the left is $0.0301$, the closest we can get to $3$%."}
knitr::include_graphics("TablesExampleLaTeXBackwards3.png")
```

Using hard copy tables, the closest value in the *body* of the table to $3$% (or $0.0300$) is $0.0301$.
This corresponds to a $z$-score of $z = -1.88$ (in the *margins* of the table).
Sometimes, the exact area can be found in the body of the table, but often the closest value in the body of the table must be used.
(The online tables give a slightly more precise value of $z = -1.881$.)
