When the $z$ scores (in the *margins* of the tables in Appendices \@ref(ZTablesNEG) and \@ref(ZTablesPOS)) were known, the *areas* were found in the *body* of the table.
If the area, or probability (in the *body* of the table) is known, the corresponding $z$-score can be found (in the *margins* of the table).
Using the hard copy tables (image below), locate the area of $0.03$ (or as close as possible), then read the $z$-score from the margins of the table.
