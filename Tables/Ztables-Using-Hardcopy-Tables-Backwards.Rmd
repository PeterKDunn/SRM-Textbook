When the $z$ scores (which are in the *margins* of the tables in Appendices \@ref(ZTablesNEG) and \@ref(ZTablesPOS)) were known, the *areas* were found in the *body* of the table.
If the area (or probability) is known (which appear in the *body* of the table), the corresponding $z$-score can be found (in the *margins* of the table), and hence the observation $x$.
