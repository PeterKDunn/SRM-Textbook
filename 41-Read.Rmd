Scientific practice requires reading the research of others.
Current practice and advances in every evidence-based discipline build on research, so being able to critique the research of others is important.
(A *critique* evaluates: identifying what is good, and what can be improved.)
Research is usually communicated in *journal articles* or, less formally, in *presentations* (Chap.\ \@ref(WritingResearch)).

At some time during your studies or employment, you will need to read researches articles: to understand current practices in your discipline; to know *why* your discipline does things as it does; to critique the evidence for current or new practices; and to identify open or unresolved questions in your discipline.
Understanding the language and concepts of research is important for understanding these articles, even if you will not be conducting your own research.

Reading research articles can be challenging.
Rather than reading articles thoroughly from start to finish, first read the *Abstract* (also called a *Summary*, or *Overview*) to obtain a useful overview of the whole paper, without the details.
Then, read the *Conclusion* highlights the important findings.
Next, skim the rest of the article (perhaps focusing on graphs and tables of results).
Finally, if necessary, read the paper for details if needed.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Terminology varies widely in research (Sect.\ \@ref(LexicalAmbiguity)).
For example, *explanatory variables*\index{Variables!explanatory} can be called, among other terms, *independent variables*, *predictors*, *regressors*, *covariates* [@dunn2016learning].
Check the terminology being used if unsure!
:::


The six steps of the research process (Sect.\ \@ref(SixStepsOfResearch)) can be used as a guide to critiquing the research, though the expectation vary greatly between disciplines and between journals:\index{Research!six steps}

1. *Asking the question*:
   * What research question is the paper answering?
   * Why is this important?
   * To what population will the results apply?
   * Are there important inclusion and/or exclusion criteria that apply?
   * What are the units of analysis and observation?
   * Are the definitions clear and appropriate?
2. *Designing the study*:
   * Is the study observational or experimental?
   * Is the study well-designed? 
   * How many individuals are in the study?
   * How was the sample obtained, and what are the implications for external validity?
   * Is the study designed to maximize internal validity? 
   * What are the design limitations?
   * Are there ethical concerns?
   * What is the source of funding?
3. *Collecting the data*:
   * How were the data collected? 
   * Is the necessary details provided so the study be approximately replicated?
4. *Summarising the data*:
   * Is the data summary appropriate, complete and clear?
   * What do these summaries reveal about the data?
   * What do the tables and graphs reveal about the data and relationships?
5. *Analysing the data*:
   * What types of confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests were used?
   * Is the analysis appropriate, accurate, valid and clear?
   * What do the results mean?
   * Are the results statistically valid?
6. *Reporting the results*:
   * What are the main conclusions, and how do they answer the RQ?
   * Are the conclusion consistent with the results?
   * Are the results accurate, appropriate and well-reported?
   * Are the results of practical importance?
   * Are the study limitations acknowledged, and their implications discussed? 
   * What other questions have emerged?


## Example: blue light and sleep {#ReadBlueLightExample}

The *Abstract* of a study of the impact of 'blue light' emitted by electronic devices on sleep [@randjelovic2023effect], slightly edited for clarity, appears below:

> The exposure of humans to artificial light at night... with predominant blue part of the visible spectrum is strongly influencing...sleep...\smallskip
>
> We hypothesized that reducing the amount of emitted blue light from screens of mobile phones during the night will increase sleep quality in our student population.\smallskip
>
> The aim [...] was to investigate the effect of reducing blue light from smartphone screen during the night on subjective quality of sleep among students of medicine.   
> The target population was students of medicine aged $20$ to $22$ years old of both sexes. 
> The primary outcome of the study was subjective sleep quality, assessed by the Serbian version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\smallskip
>
> The mean total PSQI score before intervention was $6.83\pm 2.73$ (bad), while after the intervention the same score was statistically significant reduced to $3.93 \pm 1.68$ (good)...\smallskip
>
> The study has shown that a reduction of blue light emission from LED backlight screens of mobile phones during the night leads to improved subjective quality of sleep in students...


As this is the *Abstract*, many details will be absent (but explained in the article itself).
Nonetheless, a lot can be learnt about the study from the *Abstract*:

* *Asking* the RQ:
  * The *population* is 'students of medicine aged $20$ to $22$ years old'.
  * The *units of analysis* and *observation* are the individual students in the study.\index{Units of analysis}\index{Units of observation}
    There are two units of observation for each unit of analysis: each person has a before and after measurement.
  * The outcome is the (average) subjective sleep quality, as measured by PSQI.
* *Designing* the study:
  * The sampling method is not stated, but likely to be voluntary-response.
  * The sample size is not given.
* *Analyse* the data:
  * A quantitative variable is being compared *within* individuals, so a paired $t$-test is the likely method of analysis (Sect.\ \@ref(TestPairedMeans)).
* *Report the results*:
  * Means are given *before* and *after*, but no information on the *change* is given.
  * The numbers that follow the $\pm$ are not explained: are they confidence interval limits, standard deviations, IQRs, ranges, standard errors?
  * No $P$-values or confidence intervals for the change are given.

Reading more of the article obviously provides more information.


### Further details {#ReadFurtherDetails}

Further details revealed from reading the article include:

* The *population*\index{Population} comprises students of medicine from the University of Nis, Helsinki aged $20$ to $22$ (p.\ 336), so the results will only apply to these people.
  However, other students of a similar age are probably not substantially different in this regard; however, the results may not apply to older people (whose phone use, for instance, may be quite different).
* The *inclusion* criteria are 'owning and daily usage of mobile phone with Android operating system and AMOLED screen' (p.\ 336).\index{Inclusion criteria}
  This suggests that results may not apply to users of iPhones.
* The *exclusion* criteria are 'sleep disorders, usage of sedative drugs, psychoactive substances, usage of phone apps or glasses that reduce blue light during the night, recent stressful situations' (p.\ 336).\index{Exclusion criteria}
* The *response variable*\index{Variables!response} is the PSQI total score, which ranges from $0$ to $21$; the *Abstract* implies smaller scores are better.
* The *intervention*\index{Intervention} is the use of a 'free Android application Twilight [...] on mobile phones of participants [which] automatically decreases brightness and content of emitted blue color from the screen during the night time' (p.\ 336).
* Thirty students (p.\ 337) were used in the study (the study started with $37$ students; seven dropped out).\index{Drop outs}
* Results are 'presented as mean and standard deviation before and after intervention' (p.\ 337), so presumably the numbers in the *Abstract* after the $\pm$ are *standard deviations*.
* The method of analysis was a paired $t$-test, as presumed (p.\ 337).
  The $P$-value for the $t$-test is $p < 0.0001$ (p.\ 337), so there is very strong evidence to support a change in mean PSQI.
* *Ethical approval*\index{Ethics} was granted (p.\ 336).
* The *funding* was from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia (p.\ 341), suggesting no conflicts of interest.
* The data are not available, so the research is not completely *reproducible*.\index{Research!reproducibility}


### Strengths

Strengths of the study include:

* The researchers compared the students who *remained* in the study with those who *dropped out* of the study (Table\ 1); they found no evidence that those who dropped out and those who stayed were different on the variables studied (i.e., the drop outs did not introduce a bias).\index{Bias}
* The sample size of $n = 30$ suggests the $t$-test is *statistically valid*.\index{Statistical validity}
  The required sample size is estimated using software (p.\ 336).
* An excellent case-profile plot is shown of the data (their Fig.\ 1), and the data usefully summarised in their Table\ 2. 

The authors identify strengths of the study as (p.\ 341):

> ... being specific to investigate the impact of mobile phones to sleep quality, natural setting of the intervention, pre-calculated sample size with appropriate achieved power and significant effect sizes reported (medium to large).


### Limitations

Limitations of the study identified include:

* The study is conducted 'in complete dark room without additional light'; that is, a partially artificial environment, so the results may not be *ecologically valid*.\index{Ecological validity}
* Since 'each participant was informed about the detailed plan of the study...' due to ethics requirements,\index{Ethics} (p.\ 336) the participants were not blinded to being in a study, nor the purpose of the study.\index{Blinding}
  In addition, no *control group*\index{Control} was used (p.\ 337).
  That is, the *Hawthorne effect*\index{Hawthorne effect} may impact the results.
  This means the change in PSQI may have been because students knew they were in the study, and not due to the reduction in blue light.
  The use of a control group\index{Control} would have been useful.
* Participants for the study were chosen 'on voluntary basis'\index{Sampling!Voluntary response} (p.\ 336), so the sample was not a random sample.
  The study may not be *externally valid*,\index{External validity} but the students *in* the study probably would not be very different from students who *did not* volunteer for the study.
* Since the response (PSQI) is completed by participants completing a *subjective* questionnaire, the *placebo effect*\index{Placebo effect} may be of concern (using objective measures is better when possible).
* Participants completed the questionnaire pre-intervention, then 'used the app for one month period [and] at the end they completed PSQI once again'.
  This suggests that the *carry-over effect*\index{Carry-over effect} may be an issue, since no random allocation\index{Random allocation} was used to decide which situation was evaluated  first.
* Scores are only reported for *before* and *after* intervention, not for the *changes* themselves.
* No potential confounding variable\index{Variables!confounding} are identified.

The authors identify limitations\index{Limitations} of the study as (p.\ 341):\index{Limitations}

> ... lack of generalization to other population groups, the lack of control group, the very nature of questionnaire as subjective instrument, duration of intervention, difference in devices used as well as usage time, confounding by other light sources at night. 

These include the acknowledgement of potential *confounding variables*.\index{Variables!confounding}


## Chapter summary {#Read-ChapterSummary}

The six steps of research can be used as a scaffold for critiquing research articles.
Starting by reading the *Abstract* (or *Summary*) for an overview, then the *Conclusion*, and then skim the rest of the article (perhaps focusing on graphs and tables of results).
If necessary, read the paper for details if needed.

## Exercises {#ReadExercises}

Answers to odd-numbered exercises are available in App.\ \@ref(Answers).


::: {.exercise #ReadExerciseiPhoneStepCounts}
A research article [@duncan2018walk] examined the accuracy of step counts recorded on iPhones.
The paper records this information about the selection of participants:

> Participants were recruited through word of mouth and posters displayed around the [researcher's] university.
> Participants were eligible if they were ambulatory, $\ge 18$ years of age, and owned an iPhone 6 [...] or newer model.

Although $33$ participants were selected, the authors note some parts of the study used a smaller sample size because one subject lost their phone, while others chose to withdraw from the study.
The paper notes that previous studies have been able to:

> [...] demonstrate the accuracy of the iPhone pedometer function in laboratory test conditions. However, no studies have attempted to evaluate evidence [...] in the field.

1. What is the issue that the authors raise with previous studies?
1. Why did the authors discuss the changes in sample size for some parts of the study?
1. How would you describe the sampling method?
1. What would you call the information about given about the subjects needing to be ambulatory and 18 years of age or over?
1. Among many other things, the researchers compared the *mean difference* between the number of step counts recorded by manually counting steps and the iPhone-recorded number of steps. 
   What type of test would be appropriate?
1. While walking at $2.5$\ km.h^-1^, the above test resulted in $P = 0.006$.
   What does this mean?
1. The sample size for the part of the study mentioned above was $n = 32$. 
   Do you think the test is statistically valid?
:::


::: {.exercise #ReadExerciseHeadphones}
One study of hearing loss among Iranian students [@mohammadpoorasl2018prevalence] used a non-directional study to explore the relationship between hearing loss and headphone use.
The article states that:

> ... $890$ students were randomly selected from five schools at QUMS (Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing and Midwifery, Public Health, and Paramedical Sciences schools) using a proportional cluster sampling method...

The participants completed a hearing test and completed a Hearing Loss Questionnaire (values are between $17$ and $34$:  higher scores indicating more severe hearing loss).

1. What is the population?
1. Critique the sampling method.
   What is the implication for interpreting the results of the study?
1. Some of the results are presented in 
   Table\ \@ref(tab:HearingLossTable). 
   What statistical test do you think was used to compare the scores for males and females?
1. What are the hypotheses being tested about 'Frequency of use'?
1. Form an approximate $95$% CI for the mean hearing loss score for students who use earphones. 
1. Perform a hypothesis tests to compare the *difference* between the mean hearing loss score for students who use and do not use earphones, and confirm that the $P$-value is indeed very small.

@li2017normal studied the maximum mouth opening (MMO; in mm) for $452$ Chinese adults aged from $20$ to\ $35$.

1. Would the individuals in the study likely have been blinded?
   Explain.
   What are the implications?
   
The correlation between height and MMO was given as $r = 0.54$ with $P < 0.001$.

2. What does this *mean*?

The regression equation relating the height $x$ (in cm) and MMO $y$ was given as $\hat{y} = 0.36x - 10.15$.

3. Interpret the estimates of the regression parameters.
4. Use the regression equation to predict the MMO for a person $179$\ cm tall.

The paper states that the mean MMO of males was $54.18$\ mm ($s = 5.21$), and for females was $49.62$ mm ($s = 3.69$).

5. What *type* of hypothesis tests would have been used to compare the mean MMO for males and females?
6. The paper reports the $t$-score for comparing MMO for males and females as $t = 10.63$.
   What would the $P$-value be?
7. Is this results statistically valid?
8. What is the meaning of this comparison?
9. Is gender likely to be a confounding variable in this regression analysis?
   Explain.

The author state one of the limitations as:

> First, participants were recruited from a pool of people who were undergoing regular medical examinations in our hospital [...]

10. What does this mean? 
    Are there other limitations?
