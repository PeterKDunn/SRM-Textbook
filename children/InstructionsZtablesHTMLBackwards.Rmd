When the $z$ score was known,
the tables in Appendix \@ref(ZTablesOnline) were used.
However,
when working backwards,
the tables in 
Appendix \@ref(ZTablesOnlineBackwards) are used:
enter the area to the left in search box under `Area.to.left`,
and the corresponding $z$-scores appears under the `z.score` column
(see the animation below).


<!-- ```{r TablesExampleHTMLBackwards, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='0.2\\linewidth', fig.cap='Using the online tables to find the $z$-score such that the area to the left is approximately 10%'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("./children/TablesExampleHTMLBackwards.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<div style="text-align:center;">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$video(src ="./Movies/HaveAreaFindZ.m4v", width="550", autoplay="autoplay", controls="controls", loop="loop", style="padding:5px; border: 2px solid gray;")      
```
</div>





The hardcopy tables work differently.
When the $z$ scores (which appear in the *margins* of the tables; see Sect. \@ref(UsingZTables)) is known, 
the *areas* appear in the *body* of the table. 
However if the area (or probability), which is in the *body* of the table, is known,
the corresponding $z$-score is found in the *margins* of the table,
and hence the observation $x$;
see the animation below.


<div style="text-align:center;">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$video(src ="./Movies/HaveAreaFindZHardcopy.m4v", width="700", autoplay="autoplay", controls="controls", loop="loop", style="padding:5px; border: 2px solid gray;")
```
</div>
