The online tables can be found in Appendix \@ref(ZTablesOnline).
Consider the same example again: the percentage of observations *smaller than* $z = -2$.
The online tables (Appendix \@ref(ZTablesOnline)) work with two decimal places, so consider the $z$-score as $z = -2.00$.

In the tables, enter the value `-2.00` in the search region just under the column labelled `z.score` (see the animation below).
After pressing `Enter`, the answer is shown in the column headed `Area.to.left`: the probability of finding a $z$-score less than $-2$ is 0.0228, or about 2.28\%.


<div style="text-align:center;">

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$video(src ="./Movies/HaveZFindArea.m4v", 
                      width = "500", 
                      controls = "controls", 
                      loop = "loop", 
                      style = "padding:2px;border-top:1px gray;border-bottom:1px gray;")
```
</div>

Using either the hard-copy or online tables gives an answer of about $2.28$%.
Using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule), the answer was $2.5$% (recall that the 68--95--99.7 rule is an *approximation* only).
