The online Tables work with two decimal places.
As an example, then, consider finding the area to the *left* of $z=-2.00$.
In the tables,
the value `-2` is entered in the search region, just under the column labelled `z.score`
(see the animation below).
After pressing `Enter`,
the answer is shown in the column headed `Area.to.left`:
the probability of finding a $z$-score less than $-2$ is 0.0228, or about 2.28\%.




<!-- ```{r TablesExampleHTML, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap='Using the online tables to compute the probability that $z$ is less than -2'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("./children/TablesExampleHTML.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->


<div style="text-align:center;">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$video(src ="./Movies/HaveZFindArea.m4v", width="500", autoplay="autoplay", controls="controls", loop="loop", style="padding:5px; border: 2px solid gray;")
```
</div>



The hard-copy tables work differently.
On the tables,
look for $-2.0$ in the *left* margin of the table,
and for the second decimal place (in this case, 0)
in the *top* margin of the table
(see the animation below):
where these intersect is the area (or probability) *less than* this $z$-score.
So the probability of finding a $z$-score less than $-2$ is 0.0228, or about 2.28\%.



<div style="text-align:center;">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$video(src ="./Movies/HaveZFindAreaHardcopy.m4v", width="500", autoplay="autoplay", controls="controls", loop="loop", style="padding:5px; border: 2px solid gray;")
```
</div>
