When the $z$ scores (in the *margins* of the tables in Appendices \@ref(ZTablesPOS) and \@ref(ZTablesPOS)) were known, the *areas* were found in the *body* of the table.
If the area (or probability) is known (found in the body of the table), the corresponding $z$-score can be found (in the *margins* of the table), and hence the observation $x$.
The closest area to 10% in the tables is 0.1003, or 10.03%.

To identify the diameters of the *smallest* 10% of trees, the $z$-score that has an area to the *left* of 10% (or 0.10) needs to be found (at least, as close as possible to 0.10).
