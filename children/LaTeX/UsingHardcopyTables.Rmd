To demonstration the use of the normal distribution tables, consider the percentage of observations *smaller than* $z = -2$  (that is, two standard deviations *below* the mean) in a normal distribution.
The tables (Appendices \@ref(ZTablesPOS) and \\@ref(ZTablesPOS)) work with $z$-scores to two decimal places, so consider the $z$-score as $z = -2.00$.
\medskip

On the tables, find $-2.0$ in the *left* margin of the table, and find the second decimal place (in this case, 0) in the top margin of the table (see the image on the right): where these intersect is the area (or probability) *less than* the $z$-score.
So the probability of finding a $z$-score less than $z = -2$ is 0.0228, or about 2.28\%.

The tables give the area to the **left** of the $z$-score that is looked up.
:::

Using either the hard-copy or online tables gives an answer of about $2.28$%.
Using the [68--95--99.7 rule](#def:EmpiricalRule), the answer was $2.5$% (recall that the 68--95--99.7 rule is an *approximation* only).
