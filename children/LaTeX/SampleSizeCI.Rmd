Figure \@ref(fig:SampleSizeCIWidth) shows the approximate width of the CI for estimating a proportion when different sample sizes are used.
From this graph, we can see that:

* Greater precision (*smaller* CI widths) are obtained using *larger* sample sizes (as expected);
* For *small* sample sizes (say, smaller than 15), precision is greatly increased with small increases in the sample size;
* For *large* sample sizes (say, greater than 30), precision only improves slightly when the sample size is increased.
