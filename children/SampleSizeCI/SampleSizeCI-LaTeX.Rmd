Figure\ \@ref(fig:SampleSizeCIWidth) shows the approximate width of the CI for estimating a proportion, for various sample sizes (all else being equal).
Observe that:

* greater precision (*smaller* CI width) is obtained using *larger* sample sizes.
* for *small* sample sizes (say, smaller than\ $15$), precision greatly increases with small increases in the sample size.
* for *large* sample sizes (say, greater than\ $30$), precision improves only slightly when the sample size is increased.
