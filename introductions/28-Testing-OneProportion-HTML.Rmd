You have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have also been introduced to constructing confidence intervals.
**In this chapter**, you will learn about *hypothesis tests* for one proportion.
You will learn to:
  
* conduct hypothesis tests for one sample proportion, using a $z$-test.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
