So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have also been introduced to confidence intervals.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn to construct \emph{confidence intervals} for one mean.
You will learn to:

\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item
  produce confidence intervals for one mean.
  \item
  determine whether the conditions for using the confidence intervals apply in a given situation.
\end{itemize}
