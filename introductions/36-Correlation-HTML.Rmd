So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals, and to hypothesis testing, for one groups and for comparing two separate groups.
**In this chapter**, you will learn about *correlation*.
You will learn to:

* produce correlation coefficients for exploring the relationship between two quantitative variables.
* produce and interpret $R^2$.
* conduct hypothesis tests for correlation coefficients.
