So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, form confidence intervals, and conduct hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* conduct hypothesis tests for the mean difference with paired data
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
