So far, you have learnt about the research process, including analysing data using confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* produce confidence intervals for correlation coefficients.
* conduct hypothesis tests for correlation coefficients.
* produce and interpret linear regression equations.
* conduct hypothesis tests for the slope of a regression line.
* produce confidence intervals for the slope of a regression line.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
