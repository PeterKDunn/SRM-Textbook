So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals, and began to study hypothesis testing.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn about \emph{correlation}.
You will learn to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  produce correlation coefficients for exploring the relationship between two quantitative variables.
  \item
  produce and interpret $R^2$.
  \item
  conduct hypothesis tests for correlation coefficients.
\end{itemize}
