So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, construct confidence intervals, and perform some hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* conduct hypothesis tests for comparing two means.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
