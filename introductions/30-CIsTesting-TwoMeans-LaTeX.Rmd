You have learnt to ask an RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, construct confidence intervals, and conduct hypothesis tests.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn to:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item
  identify situations where comparing two means is appropriate.
  \item
  construct confidence intervals for the difference between two independent means.
  \item
  conduct hypothesis tests for comparing two means.
  \item
  determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
\end{itemize}
