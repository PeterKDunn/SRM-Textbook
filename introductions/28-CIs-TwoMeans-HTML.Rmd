So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, form confidence intervals, and conduct hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* construct confidence intervals for the difference between two independent means.
* determine whether the conditions for using the confidence intervals apply in a given situation.
