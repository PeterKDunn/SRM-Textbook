After posing a RQ (Chap. XX), a study is designed (Chap. XX) to gather the evidence to answer the RQ (Chap. XX).
Then the data are described (Chap. XX) and summarised (Chap. XX) in preparation for answering the RQ.

Answering the RQ is difficult, since we only study one randomly-selected sample from all the numerous possible samples.
This is called \emph{sampling variation} (Chap.\ \ref{SamplingVariation}).
