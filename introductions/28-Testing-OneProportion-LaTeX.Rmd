You have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have also been introduced to constructing confidence intervals.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn about \textit{hypothesis tests} for one proportion.
You will learn to:
  
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item
  conduct hypothesis tests for one sample proportion, using a $z$-test.
  \item
  determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
\end{itemize}
