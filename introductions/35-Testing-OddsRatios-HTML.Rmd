You have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, construct confidence intervals, and perform some hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* identify situations where conducting a test for comparing two odds is appropriate.
* conduct hypothesis tests for an OR (i.e., comparing two proportions, or comparing two odds), using chi-square tests in software output.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
