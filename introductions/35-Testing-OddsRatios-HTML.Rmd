So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals, and to hypothesis testing.
**In this chapter**, you will learn about *hypothesis tests* for odds ratios.
You will learn to:

* conduct hypothesis tests for an OR (i.e., comparing two proportions, or comparing two odds), using chi-square tests in software output.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
