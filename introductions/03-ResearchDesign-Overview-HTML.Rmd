So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ.
**In this chapter**, you will learn why design is important for understanding variation in the response variable.
You will learn to:

* identify reasons why the value of the response variable varies.
* identify and distinguish extraneous, confounding and lurking variables.
* understand how chance impacts the values of the response variable.
* explain external and internal validity.
