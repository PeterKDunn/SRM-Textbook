**In this chapter**, you will learn about *internally validity* for *experimental* studies. 
You will learn to:

* maximise internal validity in experimental studies.
* manage confounding in experimental studies.
* explain, identify and manage the Hawthorne effect, the observer effect, the placebo effect and the carry-over effect in experimental studies.
* explain types of blinding.
