So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, identify studies, and design some parts of a study.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn how to maximise \emph{internally validity} for \emph{experimental} studies. 
You will learn to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  maximise internal validity in experimental studies.
  \item
  manage confounding in experimental studies.
  \item
  explain, identify and manage the carry-over effect, Hawthorne effect, placebo effect and observer effect in experimental studies.
  \item
  explain different descriptions of blinding.
\end{itemize}
