So far, you have learnt about the research process, including analysing data using confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
In the last chapter, you were introduced to plots for displaying the relationship between two quantitative variables.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn to:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item
  produce correlation coefficients for exploring the relationship between two quantitative variables.
  \item
  produce and interpret $R^2$.
  \item
  conduct hypothesis tests for correlation coefficients.
\end{itemize}
