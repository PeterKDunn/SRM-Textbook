So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, collect the data, describe the data, and graphically summarise data.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to numerically describe *quantitative* data.
Both quantitative and qualitative *data* are described numerically in *quantitative research*.
You will learn to:

* summarise quantitative data using the appropriate statistics.
* describe quantitative data by average, variation, shape and unusual features.
