So far, you have learnt about the research process, including analysing data using confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
In the last chapter, you were introduced to the correlation coefficient for quantifying the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables.

**In this chapter**, you will learn about *regression*: determining that linear relationship.
You will learn to:

* produce and interpret linear regression equations.
* conduct hypothesis tests for the slope in a regression line.
* produce confidence intervals for the slope in a regression line.
