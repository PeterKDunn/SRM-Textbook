So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, collect the sample data and describe the data.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to graph the data, so we can understand the data used to answer the RQ.
You will learn to:

* select the appropriate graphic to graphically summarise data.
* graphically summarise data using quality, appropriate graphs.
* interpret graphs.
* identify badly prepared graphics, giving reasons.
