So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, and form confidence intervals. 
**In this chapter**, you will learn to

* identify situations where estimating a mean difference is appropriate.
* construct confidence intervals for a mean difference.
* determine whether the conditions for using the confidence interval apply in a given situation.
