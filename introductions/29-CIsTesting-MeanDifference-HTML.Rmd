You have learnt to ask an RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, construct confidence intervals, and conduct hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* identify situations where mean differences are appropriate.
* construct confidence intervals for a mean difference.
* conduct hypothesis tests for the mean difference with paired data.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
