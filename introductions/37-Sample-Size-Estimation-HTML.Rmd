So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, and describe and summarise the data.
You have also been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a **proportion**.
* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a **mean**.
* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a **mean difference**.
