So far, you have learnt about the research process, including analysing data using confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
In the last chapter, you were introduced to plots for displaying the relationship between two quantitative variables.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* produce correlation coefficients for exploring the relationship between two quantitative variables.
* produce and interpret $R^2$.
* conduct hypothesis tests for correlation coefficients.
