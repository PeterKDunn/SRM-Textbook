So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals, and began to study hypothesis testing.
**In this chapter**,  you will learn about *hypothesis tests*.
You will learn to:
  
* communicate the results of hypothesis tests.
* interpret $P$-values.
