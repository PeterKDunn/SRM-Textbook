So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, and describe and summarise the data.
You have also been introduced to confidence intervals for proportions, means and mean differences.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to construct *confidence intervals* for the differences between two means.
You will learn to:

* form confidence intervals for the difference between two independent means.
* determine whether the conditions for using the confidence intervals apply in a given situation.
