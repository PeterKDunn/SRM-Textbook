So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have been introduced to the idea of correlation to measure the strength and direction of linear relationship between two quantitative variables.
**In this chapter**, you will learn about *regression*.
You will learn to:

* produce and interpret linear regression equations.
* conduct hypothesis tests for the slope in a regression line.
* produce confidence intervals for the slope in a regression line.
