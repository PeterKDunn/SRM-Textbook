So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to construct *confidence intervals* for one proportion.
You will learn to:

* identify situations where the analysis of one sample proportion is appropriate.
* form confidence intervals for single proportions.
