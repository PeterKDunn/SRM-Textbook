So far, you have learnt to ask an RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, and model sampling variation.
**In this chapter**, you will be introduced to the two big ideas in inference: *confidence intervals* and *hypothesis testing*.
You will learn to:

* explain the purpose of a confidence interval (CI).
* explain the purpose of hypothesis testing.
