So far, you have learnt about the research process, including analysing data using confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
In the last chapter, you were introduced to the correlation coefficient for quantifying the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn to:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item
  produce and interpret linear regression equations.
  \item
  conduct hypothesis tests for the slope in a regression line.
  \item
  produce confidence intervals for the slope in a regression line.
\end{itemize}
