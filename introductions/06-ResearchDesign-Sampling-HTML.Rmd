You have learnt to ask a RQ, and identify a study design.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* distinguish and explain precision and accuracy.
* distinguish and explain random and non-random sampling.
* explain why random samples are preferred over non-random samples.
* identify, describe and use different sampling methods.
* identify ways to obtain samples more likely to be representative.
