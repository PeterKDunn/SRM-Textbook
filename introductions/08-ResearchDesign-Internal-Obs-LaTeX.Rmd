So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, identify different ways of obtaining data, and design experimental studies.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn how to ensure that the conclusions we can make are logical and sound in \emph{observational} studies. 
You will learn to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  maximise the internal validity of observational studies.
  \item
  manage confounding in observational studies.
  \item
  explain, identify and manage the carry-over effect, the Hawthorne effect, the placebo effect and the observer effect in observational studies.
\end{itemize}
