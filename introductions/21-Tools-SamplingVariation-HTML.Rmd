So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, and understand the decision-making process.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to describe *sampling variation*.
You will learn to:

* explain what a sampling distribution describes.
* explain the difference between variation between individuals and variation in sample statistics.
* determine when a standard error is appropriate to use.
* explain the difference between standard errors and standard deviations.
