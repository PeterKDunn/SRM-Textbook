So far, you have learnt to ask an RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, and understand sampling variation.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* describe and draw normal distributions.
* use $z$-scores to compute probabilities related to normal distributions.
* work 'backwards' from probabilities for normal distributions.
