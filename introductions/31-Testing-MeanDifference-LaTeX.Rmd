So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals, and have studied some hypothesis tests.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn to:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item
  conduct hypothesis tests for the mean difference with paired data
  \item
  determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
\end{itemize}
