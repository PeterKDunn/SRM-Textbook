So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, and form confidence intervals.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* identify situations where estimating a difference between two means is appropriate.
* construct confidence intervals for the difference between two independent means.
* determine whether the conditions for using the confidence intervals apply in a given situation.
