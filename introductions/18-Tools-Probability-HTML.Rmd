So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, and describe and summarise the data.
**In this chapter**, you will learn about *probability* to describe the random nature of sample statistics.
You will learn to:

* explain probability.
* apply the classical and relative frequency approaches to probability in simple situations.
* identify various approaches to computing probability.
*  determine the probability of events described using **and**, **or** and **not** in simple situations.
* identify events that are independent.
* compute simple conditional probabilities.
