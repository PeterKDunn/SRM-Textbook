So far, you have learnt to ask an RQ, design a study, and describe and summarise the data.
**In this chapter**, you will learn about *probability* to describe the random nature of sample statistics.
You will learn to:

* explain probability.
* identify and apply various approaches to computing probability.
* determine the probability of events described using **and**, **or** and **not** in simple situations.
* identify events that are independent.
* compute simple conditional probabilities.
