So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, and understand the decision-making process.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn about \emph{probability} to describe the random nature of sample statistics.
You will learn to:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item
  explain probabilities.
  \item
  apply the classical approach to probability in simple situations.
  \item
  apply the relative frequency approach to probability in simple situations.
  \item
  apply the subjective approach to probability in simple situations.
  \item
  identify events that are independent.
\end{itemize}
