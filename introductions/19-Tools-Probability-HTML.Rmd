So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, and describe and summarise the data.
**In this chapter**, you will learn about *probability* to describe the random nature of sample statistics.
You will learn to:

* explain probabilities.
* apply the classical approach to probability in simple situations.
* apply the relative frequency approach to probability in simple situations.
* apply the subjective approach to probability in simple situations.
* identify events that are independent.
