You have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals, and began to study hypothesis testing.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:
  
* conduct hypothesis tests for one sample mean, using a $t$-test.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
