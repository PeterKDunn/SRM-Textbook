So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, and describe and summarise the data.
You have also been introduced to confidence intervals for proportions, means, mean differences and the difference between two means.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to construct *confidence intervals* for odds ratios.
You will learn to:

* produce confidence intervals for odds ratios using jamovi and SPSS output.
* determine whether the conditions for using the confidence intervals apply in a given situation.
