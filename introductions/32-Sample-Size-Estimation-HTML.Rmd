You have learnt to ask an RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, construct confidence intervals, and conduct hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a proportion, mean, mean difference, difference between two means, and difference between two proportions.
* explain issues relevant to estimating sample sizes.
