So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ and design experimental studies.
**In this chapter**, you will learn about *internal validity* for *observational* studies. 
You will learn to:

* maximise the internal validity in observational studies.
* manage confounding in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the Hawthorne effect, the observer effect, the placebo effect and the carry-over effect in observational studies.
