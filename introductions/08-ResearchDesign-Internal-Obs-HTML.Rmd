So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, identify different ways of obtaining data, and design experimental studies.
**In this chapter**, you will learn how to ensure that the conclusions we can make are logical and sound in *observational* studies. 
You will learn to:

* maximise the internal validity of observational studies.
* manage confounding in observational studies.
* explain, identify and manage the carry-over effect, the Hawthorne effect, the placebo effect and the observer effect in observational studies.
