So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, and describe and summarise the data.
You have also been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals.
**In this chapter**, you will learn how to compute the size sample that is needed to produce a CI with a certain coverage.
You will learn to:

* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a **proportion**.
* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a **mean**.
