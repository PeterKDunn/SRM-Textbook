So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, and collect the data.
**In this chapter**, you will learn how to describe the data, because this determines the analysis.
You will learn to:

* identify qualitative and quantitative variables.
* identify nominal and ordinal qualitative variables.
* identify continuous and discrete quantitative variables.
* classify data in ways suitable for use in software.
