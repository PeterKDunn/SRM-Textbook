So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, and describe and summarise the data.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn to:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item
  explain probability.
  \item
  apply the classical and relative frequency approaches to probability in simple situations.
  \item
  identify various approaches to computing probability.
  \item
  determine the probability of events described using \textbf{and}, \textbf{or} and \textbf{not} in simple situations.
  \item
  identify events that are independent.
  \item
  compute simple conditional probabilities.
\end{itemize}
