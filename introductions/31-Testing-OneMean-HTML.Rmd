You have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, construct confidence intervals, and perform some hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* identify situations where conducting a test for a mean is appropriate.
* conduct hypothesis tests for one sample mean, using a $t$-test.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
