So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have also been introduced to confidence intervals for proportions and means. 
**In this chapter**, you will learn to construct *confidence intervals* for mean differences (i.e., for *paired* data).
You will learn to:

* produce a confidence interval for a mean difference.
* determine whether the conditions for using the confidence interval apply in a given situation.
