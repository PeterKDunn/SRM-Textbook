So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have also been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn how to compute the size sample that is needed to produce a CI with a certain coverage.
You will learn to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a \textbf{proportion}.
  \item
  estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a \textbf{mean}.
\end{itemize}
