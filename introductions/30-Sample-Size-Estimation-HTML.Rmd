So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, form confidence intervals, and conduct hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a proportion.
* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a mean.
* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a mean difference.
* estimate the sample size for producing a CI of given width for a difference between two means.
* explain issues around estimating sample sizes.
