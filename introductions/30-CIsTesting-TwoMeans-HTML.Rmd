You have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, construct confidence intervals, and conduct hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* identify situations where comparing two means is appropriate.
* construct confidence intervals for the difference between two independent means.
* conduct hypothesis tests for comparing two means.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
