So far, you have learnt to ask an RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, and form confidence intervals.
**In this chapter**, you will learn how decisions are made in science, so you can answer RQs.
You will learn to:

* state the two broad reasons that might explain the difference between the values of the statistic and parameter.
* explain how decisions are made in research.
