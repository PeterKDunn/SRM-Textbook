So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have been introduced to the construction of confidence intervals, and to hypothesis testing.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn about \emph{regression}.
You will learn to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  produce and interpret linear regression equations.
  \item
  conduct hypothesis tests for the slope in a regression line.
  \item
  produce confidence intervals for the slope in a regression line.
\end{itemize}
