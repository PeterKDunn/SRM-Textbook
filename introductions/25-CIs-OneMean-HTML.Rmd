So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, and construct confidence intervals for one proportion.
You have also been introduced to confidence intervals.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to 

* identify situations where estimating a mean is appropriate.
* form confidence intervals for one mean.
* determine whether the conditions for using the confidence intervals apply in a given situation.
