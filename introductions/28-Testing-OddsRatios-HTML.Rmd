You have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, and perform some hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* identify situations where conducting a test for comparing two odds or proportions is appropriate.
* conduct hypothesis tests for comparing two proportions, using a $z$-test.
*  conduct hypothesis tests for comparing two odds, using chi-square tests in software output.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
