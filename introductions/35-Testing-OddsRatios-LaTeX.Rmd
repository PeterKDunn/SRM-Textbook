You have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, construct confidence intervals, and perform some hypothesis tests.
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn to:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item
  identify situations where conducting a test for comparing two means is appropriate.
  \item
  conduct hypothesis tests for an OR (i.e., comparing two proportions, or comparing two odds), using chi-square tests in software output.
  \item
  determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
\end{itemize}
