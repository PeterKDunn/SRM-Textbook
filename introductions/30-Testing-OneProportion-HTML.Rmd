So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, and construct confidence intervals.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:
  
* identify situations where conducting a test for a proportion is appropriate.
* conduct hypothesis tests for one sample proportion, using a $z$-test.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
