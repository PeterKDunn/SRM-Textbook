So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, collect the data, describe the data, and graphically summarise data.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to numerically describe *qualitative* data.
Both quantitative and qualitative *data* are described numerically in *quantitative research*.
You will learn to:

* present and numerically summarise qualitative data.
* compute and understand row and column proportions (and percentages).
* compute and understand odds and odds ratios.
* describe relationships between qualitative variables.
