So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, and understand the decision-making process.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* describe populations using normal distributions.
* use $z$-scores to compute probabilities related to normal distributions.
* work 'backwards' from probabilities for normal distributions.
