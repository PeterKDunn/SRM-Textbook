So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, describe and summarise the data, understand the decision-making process and to work with probabilities.
You have also been introduced to confidence intervals for proportions and means. 
\textbf{In this chapter}, you will learn to construct \emph{confidence intervals} for mean differences (i.e., for \emph{paired} data).
You will learn to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  produce a confidence interval for a mean difference.
  \item
  determine whether the conditions for using the confidence interval apply in a given situation.
\end{itemize}
