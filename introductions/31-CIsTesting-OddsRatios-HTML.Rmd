You have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, construct confidence intervals, and perform hypothesis tests.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* identify situations where comparing proportions or odds is appropriate.
* form confidence intervals for the difference between two proportions.
* form confidence intervals for odds ratios using software output.
* conduct hypothesis tests for comparing two proportions, using a $z$-test.
* conduct hypothesis tests for comparing two odds, using chi-square tests in software output.
* determine whether the conditions for using these methods apply in a given situation.
