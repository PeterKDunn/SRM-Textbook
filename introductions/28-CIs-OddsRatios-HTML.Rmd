So far, you have learnt to ask a RQ, design a study, classify and summarise the data, and form confidence intervals.
**In this chapter**, you will learn to:

* identify situations where comparing two qualitative variables is appropriate.
* form confidence intervals for the difference between two proportions.
* form confidence intervals for odds ratios using software output.
* determine whether the conditions for using the confidence intervals apply in a given situation.
