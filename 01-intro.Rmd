## How do we know what we know? {#smoking-study}

Science once believed that all life regularly and commonly
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'arose *spontaneously*'
} else {
   '[arose *spontaneously*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation)'
}`
from non-living matter ('spontaneous generation').

*Recipes* even existed; van Helmont [@data:VanHelmont:Transformations; @data:Latour:PasteurPouchet] gave this
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'recipe:'
} else {
   '[recipe](https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/stories/how-to-make-a-mouse-the-bizarre-recipes-borne-of-spontaneous):'
}`

>
> --- Translation of @data:VanHelmont:Transformations


We now know this isn't true... But why did van Helmont reach this conclusion?

Through *observation*.

Spontaneous generation was a theory to explain what had been *observed*.
However, this hypothesis ('possible explanation') was rejected when evidence was found that contradicted the hypothesis.
So, a new hypothesis was proposed and tested, based on further *evidence*.
Briefly, this is the *evidence-based, scientific process*.

More recently, in 1978, the verdict on the dangers of smoking was still being debated:

<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/cigarette-1270516_640.jpg" width="200px"/>

`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) '<!--'`
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.25\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.20\textwidth]{Illustrations/cigarette-1270516_640.jpg}

\end{wrapfigure}
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) '-->'`

> --- @data:burch:smokingandlungcancer, p. 456


All scientific knowledge emerges in a similar way: Observations lead to hypotheses, which are tested against the *evidence*.

The hypothesis is then either:

* *rejected* if the hypothesis is *not consistent* with the available evidence; or,
* *temporarily* accepted if the hypothesis *is consistent* with the available evidence.

Notice the approach: the hypothesis is *temporarily* accepted if it fits the available evidence.
This acceptance is only *temporary*, as contradictory evidence may emerge in the future.

Hypotheses that have not been contradicted by large amounts of evidence, over a long time, are sometimes referred to as *laws* (for example, the 'law of conservation of energy').

Knowledge in all scientific disciplines is based on a similar process:


<!--
* How do we know the gestation length for *Gilbert's Potoroo* [@stead2010monitoring]?
* How do we know that paracetamol eases pain [@weil2007paracetamol]?
* How do we know that exercise is good for us [@curfman1993exercise]?
* How do we know if 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'permeable pavement technology'
} else {
   '[permeable pavement technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeable_paving)'
}`
is effective in reducing runoff [@mullaney2014practical]?
-->



## The purpose of research

Every discipline changes, develops, improves, and adapts---usually through *research*.
The next 10 years will bring change to your discipline, and scientists, engineers and health practitioners need to know how to adapt to this change.

To remain current with developments in your discipline, understanding research is vital, even if you will not be conducting research yourself.
You still need to know the language, tools, concepts and ideas of research: research is the foundation of science.

Research seeks to

> ...confirm, refute or extend previous findings, and potentially reveal new findings...
>
> --- @anastasiadis2015framing, p. 410. 

Scientific research systematically answers questions by *observing* the world through using *data*; that is, science seeks *evidence-based answers*.

While *analysis* of data is often viewed as the hardest part of research, sometimes the hardest part is knowing *what* data to collect, and *how* to collect it (that is, the *study design*).

We study both the study design *and* the analysis of data in this book.



## Evidence-based research

'Evidence-based research' refers to research conclusions based on *evidence*,  rather than hunches, feelings, intuition, hopes, or tradition.
The **evidence** comes from analysing the collected **data**.


::: {.definition #Data name="Data"}
Data refers to information (observations or measurements) obtained from a study, such as numbers, labels, recordings, videos, text, etc.
:::


::: {.definition #DataSet name="Data set"}
A *data set* refers to an *organised* and *structured* collection of data from a study.

## Using software in research {#Software-In-Research}

Using spreadsheets for research requires extreme care; many extremely expensive and dangerous errors have been made due to using spreadsheets [@altarawneh2017pilot], including problems [reporting the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.zdnet.com/article/excel-errors-microsofts-spreadsheet-may-be-hazardous-to-your-health/).


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/students-1807505_640.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


These problems may emerge for many different reasons:
  
* Spreadsheets may *automatically alter the entered data* (for example, incorrectly reformatting entries as dates), even when not appropriate.
  This has had dire consequences [@ziemann2016gene].
* Spreadsheets may include *formulas with errors* [@panko1998hitting], that are incredibly *difficult to locate* and hence fix [@galletta1996spreadsheet; @panko2016we; @Retraction:London:Excel].
* Spreadsheets *do not leave a record* of how the data have been analysed or prepared; for example, formulas can be very difficult to understand and parse.  
  Keeping a record of the analysis, preparation of variables, and other operations with the data are part of good scientific practice ([**reproducible research**](#ReproducibleResearch) [@simons2019reproducible]).
  Reproducibility ensures, among other advantages, that results can be checked by the researchers and verified by others.
* Excel has *bugs* [@keeling2004numerical; @melard2014accuracy] even in basic operations [@berger2007nonstandard; @hargreaves2010polynomial].
  Sometimes these errors are made worse after attempts to fix them [@mccullough2002accuracy].

Most problems with using spreadsheets are due to human error, but spreadsheets make the errors hard to find and fix.
Spreadsheets are useful for data collection and manipulation, but are not designed for scientific analysis.
Be careful using spreadsheets for research and analysis...

Using *statistical* software (such as jamovi, SPSS, R, SAS, etc.) helps avoid many of these problems:

* They are designed for large data sets.
* They encourage [reproducible research](#ReproducibleResearch).
* They allow high-precision formatting and graphics.
* They are powerful; with some programming skills, almost anything is possible.  
* They are designed specifically for performing statistical analyses and working with data.


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"} 
In this book, output from the statistical software packages [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) [@Software:jamovi] and [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics) [@Software:SPSS] is sometimes shown.

## Example: Research in action {#Research-in-Action}

During 1988/1989, an unusually high number of cases of the *Legionella longbeachae* infection were observed in South Australia.
Why?
What could be done to prevent more instances?

The researchers wanted to identify the source of the infection.
They noticed that many of those infected were regular gardeners who had recently handled potting mix.

So the researchers proposed a hypothesis, that

> ... *L. longbeachae* infection was associated with handling of commercial potting mix.
>
> --- @data:oconnor:pottingmix, p. 35


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-lukas-296230.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


They designed a study to gather the relevant data, then collected the data (using a survey) from 100 people (25 people *with* the infection,  and 75 similar ('matched') people *without* the infection).

The researchers described and summarised their data, then analysed the data to reach an evidence-based conclusion: the potting mix was partially responsible for the increase in infection numbers, but other factors were also involved.

The researchers communicated their recommendations to [reduce the risks of people contracting the infection](https://www.worksafe.qld.gov.au/safety-and-prevention/hazards/hazardous-exposures/biological-hazards/legionella-risks-from-work-with-potting-mix-and-compost):

## The components of research

The research process ideally follows the process in Fig. \@ref(fig:SixSteps), but this is not always possible or practical.
The process is not always linear (researchers may jump from step to step as necessary).
Nonetheless, following this process is good practice when possible.


```{r SixSteps, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align="center", fig.width=3, out.width="35%", fig.cap="The six basic steps in research"}
SixSteps()
```


All these steps are discussed in this book:

* **Asking** the question: Chap. \@ref(RQs).  
  The research process starts when a question needs answering.
* **Designing** the study: Chaps. \@ref(ResearchDesign) to \@ref(Interpretation).  
  Once we know the question, we need the data to answer the question.
  We need to find the best way to get that data, by designing a study.
  This includes determining who or what to study, how to find them, what information to obtain, what approach to take, and ensuring data are obtained ethically.
* **Collecting** the data: Chap. \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures).  
  We need to clearly document the data collection process.
* **Describing** and **summarising** the data: Chaps. \@ref(DescribingVars) to \@ref(NumericalQual).  
  The data needs to be described and summarised (numerically and/or graphically).
* **Analysing** the data: Chaps. \@ref(MakingDecisions) to \@ref(Regression).  
  Analysis means: How do the data answer the research question?
  Analysis is often quite tricky, and the type of analysis depends on the type of data and the research question.
  Computer software is useful in this step.
* **Reporting** the results: Chaps. \@ref(Reading) and \@ref(WritingResearch).  
  Communicating the results appropriately, accurately and ethically is important, includes reporting any limitations of the study.



## Types of research {#TypesOfResearch}

The two main types of research are **qualitative** and **quantitative** research.
These are different yet complementary (Table \@ref(tab:TypesOfResearch), which is a *gross generalisation*!).


```{r echo=FALSE}
ResearchTypes <- array( dim = c(10, 3) )

ResearchTypes[1, ] <- c("",
                        "![](./Pics/iconmonstr-pen-3-240.png){#id .class height=80px width=80px}",
                        "![](./Pics/iconmonstr-calculator-9-240.png){#id .class height=80px width=80px}")
ResearchTypes[2, ] <- c("Aspect", 
                        "Qualitative", 
                        "Quantitative")

ResearchTypes[3, ] <- c("What", 
                        "Feelings, opinions",

                        "General")
ResearchTypes[6, ] <- c("Data", 
                        "Words, pictures, ...", 
                        "Numbers, statistics")
ResearchTypes[7, ] <- c("Size", 
                        "Small number", 
                        "Can be large numbers")
ResearchTypes[8, ] <- c("Time", 
                        "Time-consuming", 
                        "More efficient")
ResearchTypes[9, ] <- c("Applicability", 
                        "Rarely generalisable", 
                        "Sometimes generalisable")
ResearchTypes[10, ] <- c("Examples", 
                         "Interviews, focus groups, diaries", 
                         "Experiments, surveys measurements")

ResearchTypes <- ResearchTypes[, c(2, 1, 3) ] ### Reorder
```





```{r TypesOfResearch, echo=FALSE}
if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {

  kable(ResearchTypes[2:10,],
        format = "latex",
        align = c("r", "c", "l"),
        longtable = FALSE,
        caption = "Comparing qualitative and quantitative research",
        booktabs = TRUE) %>%
   column_spec(column = 2, 
               bold = TRUE) %>%
   row_spec(row = 1, 
            bold = TRUE) 
}
if( knitr::is_html_output(exclude = "epub") ) {
  kable(ResearchTypes,

}
if( knitr::pandoc_to("epub3")) {
 kable(ResearchTypes,
               format = "html",
               align = c("r", "c", "l"),
               longtable = FALSE,
               caption = "Comparing qualitative and quantitative research",
               booktabs = TRUE)
}
```


Both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and can be (and often are) used together, which is called **mixed methods** research.
The decision to use qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods approaches should depend on the research *problem*, not the skills of the researchers.

Briefly, *qualitative research* leads to a deeper understanding, usually from a very narrowly-defined group.
Meanings, motivations, opinions or themes often emerge from qualitative research.
Approaches to *qualitative* research [@others:robson:realworldresearch] include grounded theory, action research, and ethnography.

In contrast, *quantitative research* summarises and analyses data using *numerical* methods, such as averages and percentages. 
Specific examples of *quantitative* research approaches include observational studies and experimental studies.

In quantitative research, typically information about a larger group of interest (a *population*) is found from a subset of the population (a *sample*)\index{sample}

::: {.example #BroadTypesOfResearch name="Types of research"}
Suppose we wish to learn about the perceived benefits and barriers for adopting electric vehicles (EVs)
(@guevara2021paving; also see @egbue2012barriers).

A *qualitative research study* might use two small *focus groups*: One group who *have* purchased EV, and another group who *have not* purchased EVs.
The researchers ask each group about their perceived benefits and barriers for adopting EVs.

A *quantitative research* study might survey a large number of buyers and non-buyers of EVs, and ask the buyers' age, sex, and questions about why they purchased their car.

The survey responses could be analysed by numerically summarising, and comparing, the responses for buyers and non-buyers of EVs.

A *mixed methods* study (such as @guevara2021paving) may combine both of the above.
