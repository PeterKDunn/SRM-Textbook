## How do we know what we know? {#smoking-study}

People once believed that all life commonly and regularly
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'arose *spontaneously*'
} else {
   '[arose *spontaneously*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation)'
}`
from non-living matter ('spontaneous generation').

Furthermore,
any life form could be created on-demand from non-living things by following *recipes*.

J. B. van Helmont [@data:VanHelmont:Transformations; @data:Latour:PasteurPouchet] gave 
this
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'recipe:'
} else {
   '[recipe](https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/stories/how-to-make-a-mouse-the-bizarre-recipes-borne-of-spontaneous):'
}`

We now know that this isn't true...
But how did van Helmont reach this conclusion?

By *observing*.

This is what van Helmont had *observed*, and he proposed a possible explanation (a scientific *hypothesis*)\index{hypothesis}
to explain that observation.
And why was his hypothesis rejected?
Because of the *scientific process*.

Spontaneous generation was proposed after making *observations*.
van Helmont then proposed a possible explanation (a scientific *hypothesis*),
but this hypothesis was then rejected when evidence contradicted the hypothesis.
So, a new hypothesis was proposed and tested, based on further *evidence*.
Briefly, this is the *evidence-based, scientific process*.\index{scientific process}

More recently, cigarette smoking was declared harmful by applying the scientific process.
As recently as 1978, 
the verdict on the dangers of smoking was still being debated:


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/cigarette-1270516_640.jpg" width="200px"/>

`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) '<!--'`
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.25\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.20\textwidth]{Illustrations/cigarette-1270516_640.jpg}
  \end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) '-->'`

All scientific knowledge emerges in a similar way:
Observations lead to hypotheses,
which are tested against the *evidence*.

The hypothesis is then either:

* *rejected* if the hypothesis is *not consistent* with the available evidence; or,
* *temporarily* accepted if the hypothesis *is consistent* with the available evidence.

Notice the approach:
the hypothesis is *temporarily* accepted if it fits the available evidence.
This acceptance is only *temporary*, as contradictory evidence may eventually emerge in the future.

Hypotheses that have been supported by large amounts of evidence, over a long period of time, are sometimes referred to as *laws*, often within a given scope of application (for example, the 'law of conservation of energy').
In other words, these laws could be amended, contradicted or their scope changed as new evidence emerges.

Knowledge in all scientific disciplines is based on a similar process:

* How do we know the gestation length for *Gilbert's Potoroo* [@stead2010monitoring]?
* How do we know that paracetamol eases pain [@weil2007paracetamol]?
* How do we know that exercise is good for us [@curfman1993exercise]?
* How do we know if 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'permeable pavement technology'
} else {
   '[permeable pavement technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeable_paving)'
}`
is effective in reducing runoff [@mullaney2014practical]?




## The purpose of research

Every scientific discipline 
has changed in the last 10 years.
Likewise,
the next 10 years will also bring change.
Scientists, engineers and health practitioners need to know how to adapt to this change.

Every discipline changes, develops, improves, and adapts---usually through *research*.
To remain current with developments in your discipline,
you need to understand research,
even if you will not be conducting research yourself.

Everyone in science-based disciplines must know
the language, tools, concepts and ideas of research:
Research is the foundation of science.

Research seeks to

> ...confirm, refute or extend previous findings, and potentially reveal new findings...
>
> --- @anastasiadis2015framing, p. 410. 

Scientific research formally answers questions that arise 
by *observing* the world through the use of *data*;
that is,
science requires *evidence-based answers*.

While *analysis* of the data is often viewed as the hardest part of research,
sometimes the hardest part is knowing *what* data to collect,
and *how* to collect it (that is, the *study design*).

We study both the study design *and* the analysis of data in this book.





## Evidence-based research

'Evidence-based research' refers to research conclusions based on *evidence*, 
rather than hunches, feelings, intuition, hopes, or tradition.

Research conclusions are based on **evidence**,
which comes from analysing
the collected **data**.


::: {.definition #Data name="Data"}
Data refers to information (observations or measurements)
obtained from a study,
as numbers, labels, recordings, videos, text, etc.
:::


**Data** can come from previously-published studies
(Chap. \@ref(Reading)).
Even so,
studies usually leave questions unanswered, 
or technology develops and new ideas need to be tested, 
or existing ideas need to be adapted to new technologies, situations and knowledge.

In these cases,
**data** comes from *new* evidence,
through research.


::: {.definition #DataSet name="Data set"}
A *data set*
refers to a *structured* collection of data from a study.
:::

## Using software in research {#Software-In-Research}

Many people use spreadsheets (such as Microsoft Excel) for analysis of data in research.

Using spreadsheets for research requires extreme care;
many extremely expensive and dangerous errors have been made due to using spreadsheets
[@altarawneh2017pilot],
including problems 
[when reporting the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.zdnet.com/article/excel-errors-microsofts-spreadsheet-may-be-hazardous-to-your-health/).



<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/students-1807505_640.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>

These problems may emerge for many different reasons:
  
* Spreadsheets can *automatically alter the entered data* 
  (for example, reformatting entries as dates if the spreadsheet *thinks* the data should be a date),
  even when not appropriate.
  This has had dire consequences [@ziemann2016gene].
* Spreadsheets may include *formulas with errors* [@panko1998hitting], 
  that are incredibly *difficult to locate* and hence fix 
  [@galletta1996spreadsheet; @panko2016we; @Retraction:London:Excel].
* Spreadsheets *do not leave a record* of how the data have been analysed or prepared;
  for example, formulas can be very difficult to understand and parse.  
  
  Keeping a record of the analysis, preparation of variables, and other operations with the data
  are part of what is called [**reproducible research**](#ReproducibleResearch) [@simons2019reproducible].
  Reproducibility ensures, among other advantages, 
  that the results can be checked by the researchers and by others, for accuracy.
* Excel has *bugs*
  [@keeling2004numerical; @melard2014accuracy]
  even in very basic operations
  [@berger2007nonstandard; @hargreaves2010polynomial].
  After trying to fix these bugs, sometimes they are made even worse
  [@mccullough2002accuracy].

Spreadsheets can be used for research and analysis...
but you must be very careful!

Many problems with using spreadsheets are due to human error,
but spreadsheets make the errors hard to find.
Some errors emerge because Excel is being used for purposes it is not really designed for (i.e., scientific analysis).


Using *statistical* software (such as jamovi, SPSS, R, SAS, etc.) helps avoid many of these problems:

* They are designed for large data sets.
* They encourage [reproducible research](#ReproducibleResearch).
* They allow high-precision formatting and graphics.
* They are powerful; with some programming skills, almost anything is possible.  
* They are designed specifically for performing statistical analyses and working with data.

## Example: Research in action {#Research-in-Action}

During 1988/1989,
an unusually high number of cases of the
*Legionella longbeachae* infection were observed in South Australia.
Why?
What could be done to prevent more instances?

The researchers wanted to identify the source of the infection.
They noticed that many of those infected 
were regular gardeners who had recently handled potting mix.

So the researchers proposed a hypothesis, that

> ... *L. longbeachae* infection was associated with 
> handling of commercial potting mix.
>
> --- @data:oconnor:pottingmix, p. 35


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-lukas-296230.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


They designed a study,
then gathered data (using a survey) from 100 people:
25 people *with* the *L. longbeachae* infection, 
and 75 similar ('matched', or similar) people *without* the infection

The researchers described and summarised their data,
then analysed the data to reach an evidence-based conclusion:
the potting mix was partially responsible for the increase
in infection numbers, 
but other factors were also involved.

The researchers then communicated their recommendations to 
[reduce the future risks of people contracting the infection](https://www.worksafe.qld.gov.au/safety-and-prevention/hazards/hazardous-exposures/biological-hazards/legionella-risks-from-work-with-potting-mix-and-compost):

> Raising people's awareness of a possible health risk when using potting mix 
> should continue in order to protect against *L. longbeachae* infection.

In the rest of this book, we learn about the *six components of research*.
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {
   "See if you can arrange the steps of research into the correct order:"
}`
`r if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {
   "See if you can arrange the steps of research into the correct order, using these terms: Design; Summarise and describe; Analyse; Ask; Collect; Report."
}`

**Step 1**:
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( 
   c("Design",
     "Summarise and describe",
     "Analyse",
     answer = "Ask",
     "Collect",
     "Report") )
  } else {
    "_________"}` the question

**Step 2**:

   c(answer = "Design",
     "Summarise and describe",
     "Analyse",
     "Ask",
     "Collect",
     "Report") )
  } else {
    "_________"}` the study

**Step 3**:

## The components of research

The research process typically follows the process in
Fig. \@ref(fig:SixSteps).
This is not always possible or practical,
and the process is not always linear
(researchers may jump from step to step as necessary).
Nonetheless,
following this process is good practice when possible.


```{r SixSteps, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align="center", fig.width=3, out.width="35%", fig.cap="The six basic steps in research"}
set.seed(791)
SixSteps()
```


All these steps
are discussed in this book:

* **Asking** the question: Chap. \@ref(RQs).  
The research process usually starts by asking the questions.
Once we know the question, we know what data is needed to answer the question, we can think about how to get that information.
* **Designing** the study: Chaps. \@ref(ResearchDesign) to \@ref(Interpretation).  
Designing the study involves thinking about how to collect the data. 
This includes thinking about who or what to study, how to find them, what data to obtain, what approach to take, how to get effective data, and ensuring data is obtained ethically.
* **Collecting** the data: Chap. \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures).  
There are many ways to collect the data: experiments, in science laboratories, administering surveys, etc.
* **Describing** and **summarising** the data: Chaps. \@ref(DescribingVars) to \@ref(NumericalQual).  
Data, especially when there are lot of it, can be hard to understand. 
So once we have the data, we should first describe each variable, and give summaries of each variable. 
These summaries may be numerical or graphical.
* **Analysing** the data: Chaps. \@ref(MakingDecisions) to \@ref(Regression).  
This means: How do the data answer the research question we started with?
The analysis step is often quite tricky. 
Many analysis methods are available, and the type of analysis depends on the type of data obtained and the research question to be answered.
Computer software is useful in this step.
* **Reporting** the results: Chaps. \@ref(Reading) and \@ref(WritingResearch).  
Communicating the results appropriately, accurately and ethically is important. 
This includes reporting any limitations of the study.




## Types of research {#TypesOfResearch}

Research is a formal, evidence-based approach to learning or creating new information.
The two main types of research are
**qualitative** and **quantitative** research.

These two types of research are 
different and complementary 
(Table \@ref(tab:TypesOfResearch),
which is a *gross generalisation*!).


```{r echo=FALSE}
ResearchTypes <- array( dim = c(10, 3) )

                        "Words, pictures, ...", 
                        "Numbers, statistics")
ResearchTypes[7, ] <- c("Size", 
                        "Small number", 
                        "Can be large numbers")
ResearchTypes[8, ] <- c("Time", 
                        "Time-consuming",

                        "Rarely generalisable",

ResearchTypes[10, ] <- c("Examples", 
                         "Interviews, focus groups, diaries", 
                         "Experiments, surveys measurements")

ResearchTypes <- ResearchTypes[, c(2, 1, 3) ] ### Reorder
```





```{r TypesOfResearch, echo=FALSE}
if( knitr::is_latex_output() ) {

  kable(ResearchTypes[2:10,],

        longtable = FALSE,
        caption = "Comparing qualitative and quantitative research",
        booktabs = TRUE) %>%
   column_spec(column = 2, 
               bold = TRUE) %>%

               caption = "Comparing qualitative and quantitative research",
               booktabs = TRUE)
}
```


Both methods have advantages and disadvantages,
and both can be,
and often are,
used together: 
using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research
is called **mixed methods** research.

The decision to use qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods approaches should
depend on the research problem, not the skills of the researchers.

Briefly,
*qualitative research* leads to a deeper understanding of what is being studied,
usually about a very narrowly-defined group.
Meanings, motivations, opinions or themes often emerge from qualitative research.
Approaches to *qualitative* research
[@others:robson:realworldresearch]
include grounded theory, action research, and ethnography.

Briefly,
*quantitative research* summarises and analyses data
using *numerical* methods, 
such as averages and percentages. 
Specific examples of *quantitative* research approaches
include observational studies and experimental studies.


In quantitative research,
typically information about a larger group of interest (a *population*)\index{population}
is found from a subset of the population (a *sample*)\index{sample}

Suppose we wish to learn about the perceived benefits and barriers for adopting electric vehicles (EVs)

A *qualitative research study* might use a *focus group* to interview:

* Another small group of people who have *not* purchased EVs.

The researchers ask about their perceived benefits and barriers for adopting EVs.

A *quantitative research* study
might survey a larger number of buyers and non-buyers of EVs,
and ask the buyers' age, sex, and car purchased.

The survey may ask respondents to identify attributes of car buying 
(such as energy costs; maintenance costs; range; purchase price; etc.)
as either as advantages, disadvantages, or as indifferent when purchasing an EV.

The survey responses could be analysed by numerically summarising, and comparing, the responses
for buyers and non-buyers of EVs.

A *mixed methods* study (such as @guevara2021paving) may combine both of the above.
