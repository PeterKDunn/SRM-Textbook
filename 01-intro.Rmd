## How do we know what we know? {#HowDoWeKnow}

People once believed that all life regularly and commonly
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'arose spontaneously'
} else {
   '[arose spontaneously](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_generation)'
}`
from non-living matter.
*Recipes* even existed to create life; for example, van Helmont [@data:VanHelmont:Transformations; @data:Latour:PasteurPouchet] gave this
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'recipe'
} else {
   '[recipe](https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/stories/how-to-make-a-mouse-the-bizarre-recipes-borne-of-spontaneous)'
}`
for making a mouse:

> If a soiled shirt is placed in the opening of a vessel containing grains of wheat, the reaction of the leaven in the shirt with fumes from the wheat will, after approximately twenty-one days, transform the wheat into mice.

This idea was called 'spontaneous generation'.
We now know this isn't true... but where did the idea come from?
Through *observation*.

Spontaneous generation was consistent with what had been *observed*: following the above process *did* produce mice.
However, this hypothesis ('possible explanation') was rejected when evidence was found that contradicted the hypothesis.
So, a new hypothesis was proposed and tested, based on further *evidence*, and new hypotheses were put forward that were consistent with all the evidence.
Briefly, this is the *evidence-based, scientific process*.

More recently, the dangers of smoking were still being debated into the 1990s:


<!-- \begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.25\textwidth} -->
<!--   \begin{center} -->
<!--     \includegraphics[width=.20\textwidth]{Illustrations/cigarette-1270516_640.jpg} -->
<!--   \end{center} -->
<!-- \end{wrapfigure} -->



> ...  a causal role for smoking [has] not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
>
> --- @eysenck1991were, p. 429


All scientific knowledge emerges in a similar way: Observations lead to hypotheses, which are tested against the *evidence*.
If the evidence *contradicts* the hypothesis, the hypothesis is rejected; if the evidence is *consistent* with the hypothesis, the hypothesis is *temporarily* accepted (since contradictory evidence may emerge in the future).

Hypotheses not contradicted by large amounts of evidence, over a long time, are sometimes called *laws* or *theories* (such as the 'law of conservation of energy').
Importantly, theories and laws can be disproven if contradictory  evidence emerges.

Knowledge in all scientific disciplines is accumulated using a similar process.

## Evidence-based research {#EvidenceBasedResearch}

Every discipline changes, develops, improves, and adapts---usually through *research*.
Your discipline is not the same as it was $10$ years ago; it will change in the next $10$ years.
Scientists, engineers and health practitioners need to know how to understand and adapt to this change.

To remain current in your discipline, understanding research is vital, even if you will not be conducting research yourself.
You still need to know the language, tools, concepts and ideas of research: you need to know how to critique research.
research is the foundation of science.

Scientific research systematically answers questions using *data*; that is, science seeks *evidence-based answers*.
'Evidence-based research' refers to research conclusions based on *evidence*,  rather than hunches, feelings, intuition, hopes, or tradition.
The *evidence* comes from analysing the collected *data*.


::: {.definition #Data name="Data"}
Data refers to information (observations or measurements) obtained from a study, such as numbers, labels, recordings, videos, text, etc.
:::


::: {.definition #DataSet name="Dataset"}
A *dataset* refers to an *organised* and *structured* collection of data from a study.
:::


Research involves designing how to collect data, and analysing that data; this book covers both parts.

## Example: research in action {#Research-in-Action}

During 1988/1989, an unusually high number of cases of the *Legionella longbeachae* infection were observed in South Australia.
The researchers wanted to identify the source of the infection to prevent further infections.

The researchers noticed that many of those infected were gardeners who had recently handled potting mix, so they hypothesised that the infection was somehow associated with using potting mix.
They designed a study to test this hypothesis, then collected data from 100 people ($25$ *with* the infection, and $75$ similar people *without* the infection).


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/pexels-lukas-296230.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


The researchers described and summarised their data, then analysed the data to reach an evidence-based conclusion: potting mix was partially, but not solely, responsible for the increase in infection numbers.
The researchers communicated their recommendations to 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'reduce the risks of people contracting the infection.'
} else {
   '[reduce the risks of people contracting the infection](https://www.worksafe.qld.gov.au/safety-and-prevention/hazards/hazardous-exposures/biological-hazards/legionella-risks-from-work-with-potting-mix-and-compost).'

## Types of research {#TypesOfResearch}

Research can be broadly classified as *qualitative* or *quantitative* research, which are different yet complementary (Table\ \@ref(tab:TypesOfResearch)).
Both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and are often used together (called *mixed methods* research).
The decision to use qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods approaches should depend on the aims of the research, not the skills or knowledge of the researchers conducting the research.

         row_spec(row = 2, 
                  bold = TRUE)
}
```



Briefly, *qualitative research* leads to a deeper understanding, usually from a very narrowly-defined group.
Meanings, motivations, opinions or themes often emerge from qualitative research.
In contrast, *quantitative research* summarises and analyses data usually from large groups, using *numerical* methods, such as averages and percentages. 
In quantitative research, typically information about a larger group of interest (a *population*) is found from a subset of the population (a *sample*).

::: {.definition #QualitativeResearch name="Quantitative research"}
*Quantitative research* summarises and analyses data using numerical methods, such as producing averages and percentages. 
:::


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
This book is about *quantitative* research.

::: {.example #BroadTypesOfResearch name="Types of research"}
Suppose we wish to learn about the perceived benefits and barriers for adopting electric vehicles (EVs).

A *qualitative research study* might use two small *focus groups*: one group comprising people who *have* purchased EV, and another group comprising people who *haven't*.
The researchers ask each group about the reasons for their purchase.

A *quantitative research* study might survey a large number of buyers of EVs and buyers of non-EVs, and ask the buyers' age, sex, and questions about the reasons for their purchase.
The survey responses could be analysed by numerically summarising, and comparing, the responses for buyers and non-buyers of EVs.

A *mixed methods* study may combine both of the above.
:::


## The steps in research {#SixStepsOfResearch}

The research process ideally follows the process in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SixSteps), but this is not always possible or practical.
The process is not always linear: researchers may jump from step to step as necessary.
Nonetheless, each step is important.


```{r SixSteps, fig.cap="", fig.align="center", fig.width=3, out.width="35%", fig.cap="The six basic steps in research. The steps are not always performed linearly."}
SixSteps()
```


All steps are discussed in this book:

* **Asking** the research question: Chap.\ \@ref(RQs).
  Research begins by asking a question.
* **Designing** the study: Chaps.\ \@ref(ResearchDesign) to\ \@ref(Interpretation).
  In evidence-based research, the question is answered using data.
  A study must be designed to obtain that data, which includes determining who or what to study, how to find them, what information to obtain, and ensuring data are obtained ethically.
* **Collecting** the data: Chap.\ \@ref(CollectingDataProcedures).
  The data collection process must be clearly documented.
* **Describing** and **summarising** the data: Chaps.\ \@ref(DescribingVars) to\ \@ref(NumericalQual).
  Before analysis, the data must be described and summarised.
  A computer is useful for this step.
* **Analysing** the data: Chaps.\ \@ref(MakingDecisions) to\ \@ref(Regression).
  Analysis refers to determining how the data answer the research question, and depends on the type of data and the research question.
  A computer is useful for this step.
* **Reporting** the results: Chaps.\ \@ref(Reading) and\ \@ref(WritingResearch).
  Communicating the results appropriately, accurately and ethically is important, includes reporting any limitations of the study.


## Using software in research {#Software-In-Research}

Using spreadsheets in research for storing and analysing data requires care; extremely expensive and dangerous errors have been made due to using spreadsheets [@altarawneh2017pilot].
These problems emerge for different reasons:


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/students-1807505_640.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


  
* Spreadsheets may *automatically alter data* (for example, reformatting entries as dates), even when not appropriate [@ziemann2016gene].
* Spreadsheets may include *formulas with errors* [@panko1998hitting] that are *difficult to locate* and hence fix [@panko2016we; @Retraction:London:Excel].
* Spreadsheets *do not leave a record* of how the data have been analysed or prepared; for example, formulas can be difficult to understand and parse.
  Keeping a record of the analysis, preparation of variables, and other operations with the data is good scientific practice (*reproducible research*; see Sect.\ \@ref(ReproducibleResearch)) [@simons2019reproducible]).
  Reproducibility ensures, among other advantages, that results can be checked by the researchers and verified by others.
* Excel has *bugs* [@keeling2004numerical; @melard2014accuracy] even in basic operations [@berger2007nonstandard; @hargreaves2010polynomial].
  Sometimes these errors are made worse after attempts to fix them [@mccullough2002accuracy].

Problems with using spreadsheets, as with any software package, are often due to human error, but *spreadsheets make the errors hard to find and fix*.
Spreadsheets are useful for data collection and manipulation, but are not designed for scientific analysis.
Be careful using spreadsheets for research and analysis.

*Statistical* software (such as jamovi, Python, R, SAS, SPSS, etc.) helps avoid many of these problems.
Statistical software:

* is designed for large datasets.
* encourages reproducible research (Sect. \@ref(ReproducibleResearch)).
* allows high-precision formatting and graphics.
* is powerful; with some programming skills, almost anything is possible.
* is designed for performing statistical analyses and working with data.
