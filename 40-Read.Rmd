Scientific practice requires reading the research of others.
Advances in every science-based discipline build on existing research, so being able to critique the research of others is important.
Research is usually communicated in *journal articles* (also called *papers*), or in *presentations* (conferences; seminars).
Millions of journal articles are available (this book references many articles).

At some time during your studies, you will need to read researches articles: to understand current practices in your discipline; to know *why* your discipline does things as it does; to critique the evidence for current practices; and to identify open or unresolved questions in your discipline.
Understanding the language of research is important for understanding these articles, even if you will not be conducting your own research.

Reading research articles can be challenging.
Start by reading the *Abstract* (also called a *Summary*, or *Overview*), as it provides a useful overview of the whole paper (without the details).

To understand a paper, the six steps of the research process (Sect.\ \@ref(SixStepsOfResearch)) can be used as a guide:

1. *Ask the question*:
   * What research question is the paper answering?
   * Why is this important?
   * To what population do the results apply?
   * Are there important inclusion and/or exclusion criteria that apply?
2. *Design the study*:
   * How did the authors design the study? 
   * Is the study observational or experimental?
   * How many individuals are in the study?
   * How was the sample obtained, and what are the implications for external validity?
   * Is the study designed to maximize internal validity? 
   * What are the design limitations?
3. *Collect the data*:
   * How were the data collected? 
   * Could the study be approximately repeated if needed?
4. *Describe and summarise the data*:
   * Is the data summary appropriate, complete and clear?
   * What do these summaries reveal about the data?
   * What do the tables and graphs reveal about the data and relationships?
5. *Analyse the data*:
   * What types of confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests were used?
   * Is the analysis appropriate, accurate, valid and clear?
   * What do the results mean?
6. *Report the results*:
   * What are the main conclusions? How do they answer the RQ?
   * Are the results accurately, appropriately and well reported?
   * Are the results of practical importance?
   * What is the answer to the RQ? 
   * Are the study limitations acknowledged, and their implications discussed? 
   * What other questions have emerged?

<!-- A study [@data:Fritts2018:Vegetables] explored the impact of adding herbs and spices on the consumption of vegetables by adolescent school children. -->
<!-- Part of the Abstract states (slightly edited for brevity): -->

<!-- > *Purpose*: We evaluated whether new vegetable recipes using herbs and spices would increase preference for vegetables served to adolescents at this school.\smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > *Methods*: To evaluate recipe acceptance, we assessed liking ($100$\ mm visual analog scales) among students ($n = 96--110$; aged $14$--$18$ years) for $8$ plain (oil and salt) and $8$ seasoned vegetables.  -->
<!-- > Liking ratings between plain and seasoned vegetables were compared with paired $t$-tests... \smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > *Results*: Students reported higher liking for several seasoned recipes compared to plain: broccoli ($P = 0.02$), vegetable dip ($P < 0.0001$), black beans and corn ($P < 0.001$) and cauliflower ($P < 0.0001$).\smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > *Conclusions*: Common herbs and spices improved liking for several school lunch vegetables compared to plain varieties among rural high school students... -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > --- @data:Fritts2018:Vegetables, p. 125 -->

<!-- Later we read this (again, slightly edited): -->

<!-- > This is a cross-sectional [i.e., non-directional] study assessing preference for plain and seasoned vegetables in a population of middle/high school students (aged $14$--$18$ years) attending a rural Pennsylvania public school.  -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > --- @data:Fritts2018:Vegetables, p. 126 -->

<!-- Even using this small amount of information (the original article is ten pages long), much can be learnt about the study.  -->
<!-- For example: -->

<!-- 1. **Ask the question**:  -->
<!--    The POCI elements are: -->

<!--    * *Population*: 'middle/high school students (aged $14$--$18$ years) attending a rural Pennsylvania public school' -->
<!--    * *Outcome*: The *mean difference* in taste ratings between plain and seasoned vegetables. -->
<!--      The taste ratings are given using a '$100$\ mm visual analog scale'. -->
<!--    * *Comparison*: There is **no** comparison: -->
<!--      Every member of the population is treated the same way. -->
<!--      A comparison exists if different subsets of the population are treated differently (for example, one group of students is given plain vegetables, and a different group is given seasoned vegetables). -->
<!--    * *Intervention*: No; there is no comparison, so there is no comparison to be allocated to different groups of the population. -->
<!-- 2. **Design the study**:  -->
<!--     Since this RQ is *descriptive*, the study is *descriptive*. -->
<!--     The participants were probably not *blinded*, since the presence of seasoning was probably obvious. -->
<!--     About 100 students were used, so the sample size is large. -->
<!-- 3. **Collect the data**: -->
<!--     No details are given about the data collection in this information. -->
<!-- 4. **Describe and summarise the data**: -->
<!--    The Abstract gives no summary data (since eight vegetables were studied, this would have consumed too much space I guess). -->
<!-- 5. **Analyse the data**: -->
<!--    The data were analysed using *paired* $t$-tests, one for each different vegetable used. -->
<!--    (Each subject gave two ratings for each vegetable: one for *plain* vegetables and one for *seasoned* vegetables), -->
<!-- 6. **Report the results**: -->
<!--    Evidence exists of a mean difference (that students preferred the seasoned vegetables) in many cases, but not all: the Abstract states that eight vegetables were used, with statistically significant differences (i.e., $P < 0.05$) for five. -->

<!-- For more details, the whole paper could be read. -->

<!-- Consider this Abstract [@data:Groves:bicycleweight] (slightly edited): -->

<!-- > **Objective** To determine whether the author's $20.9$\ lb ($9.5$\ kg) carbon frame bicycle reduced commuting time compared with his $29.75$\ lb ($13.5$\ kg) steel frame bicycle.\smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > **Design** Randomised trial.\smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > **Setting** Sheffield and Chesterfield, UK, between mid-January 2010 and mid-July 2010. \smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > **Participants** One consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care. \smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > **Main outcome measure** Total time to complete the $27$ mile ($43.5$ kilometre) journey from Sheffield to Chesterfield Royal Hospital and back.\smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > **Results** The total distance travelled on the steel frame bicycle during the study period was $809$ miles ($1302$\ km) and on the carbon frame bicycle was $711$ miles ($1144$\ km).  -->
<!-- > The difference in the mean journey time between the steel and carbon bicycles was $00$:$00$:$32$ (hr:min:sec; $95$% CI $-00$:$03$:$34$ to $00$:$02$:$30$; $P = 0.72$).\smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > **Conclusions** A lighter bicycle did not lead to a detectable difference in commuting time. -->
<!-- > Cyclists may find it more cost effective to reduce their own weight rather than to purchase a lighter bicycle.\smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > --- @data:Groves:bicycleweight, p. 341 -->

<!-- Based on this Abstract, again we can learn many things about the study: -->

<!-- 1. **Ask the question**: -->
<!--    The POCI elements are: -->

<!--    * *Population*: The trips by *this* rider, on *his* bikes, on *his* route to work. -->
<!--      This is not easy to identify, but notice that there are many examples of this rider, on his bikes, on his route. -->
<!--      Only one bike, one rider, and one route is used. -->
<!--    * *Outcome*: 'Total time to complete the $27$ mile ($43.5$ kilometre) journey'. -->
<!--    * *Comparison*: Between the steel-frame and carbon-frame bicycles. -->
<!--    * *Intervention*: Yes, because the elements of the population (the different commutes) can be randomly allocated to be taken with the steel- or carbon-frame bikes. -->
<!-- 2. **Design the study**: -->
<!--    The study is 'randomised controlled trial', a type of experimental study. -->
<!--    Random allocation has been used (which bike to use each day). -->
<!-- 3. **Collect the data**: -->
<!--    The Abstract gives no information. -->
<!-- 4. **Describe and summarise the data**: -->
<!--    The Abstract gives no summary data for each bike, but summarises the *difference* between the means: $32$ seconds ($95$% CI between $-3$:$34$ and $2$:$30$ minutes, but *which* bike produces the faster mean time is not stated). -->
<!-- 5. **Analyse the data**: -->
<!--    Though not stated, probably a two-sample $t$-test. -->
<!-- 6. **Report the results**: -->
<!--    'A lighter bicycle did not lead to a detectable difference in commuting time': -->
<!--    There is no evidence that the carbon-frame bicycle reduced the commuting time (for this rider, on his route to work, with his bikes...). -->
<!--    In any case, the difference between the two mean commuting times is $32$\ s... over a $43.5$\ km journey: -->
<!--    Hardly of any *practical* importance (Sect.\ \@ref(PracticalSignificance))! -->


<!-- One thing to observe: -->
<!-- The RQ is *one*-tailed (does the carbon frame bicycle *reduce* commuting time), but the conclusion gives a *two*-tailed $P$-value. -->
<!-- (This may not be obvious, but a one-tailed $P$-value cannot be larger than $0.5$.) -->


<!-- ## Example: test -->

<!-- [1] L. Guirao, C. B. Samitier, M. Costea, J. M. Camos, M. Majo, and E. Pleguezuelos. Improvement in walking abilities in transfemoral amputees with a distal weight bearing implant. Prosthetics and Orthotics International, 4(26–32), 2017. -->



<!-- > *Background:* The ability to walk with a prosthesis is the main objective of rehabilitation following amputation, and distance -->
<!-- and speed of walking achieved are considered determining factors in amputees’ perception of quality-of-life.\smallskip -->
<!-- >  -->
<!-- > *Objectives:* To assess walking abilities and improvement in gait distance and speed parameters in patients undergoing -->
<!-- transfemoral amputation with a femoral implant that allows distal support of the residuum.\smallskip -->

<!-- > *Study design:* Experimental before-and-after study.\smallskip -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > *Methods:* Ten transfemoral amputation patients received a titanium implant that allowed distal weight bearing of the residuum within the socket.  -->
<!-- > The post-intervention follow-up period was $14$ months.  -->
<!-- We evaluated the functionality using a $2$-min walk test and the physiological cost index.\smallskip -->
<!-- >  -->
<!-- > *Results:* The etiology of amputation was traumatic in six patients (60%).  -->
<!-- > The mean 2-min walk test score was $98.4\pm 19.5$\ m prior to the femoral implant and $122.5\pm 26.1$\ m at $14$\ months ($p < 0.008$), representing an improvement of $24.5$%. -->
<!-- > The mean gait speed prior to the femoral implant was $0.82\pm 0.16$ and $1.02\pm 0.21$\ m/s at $14$ months ($p < 0.008$).  -->
<!-- > The physiological cost index showed no differences ($p < 0.55$).\smallskip -->
<!-- >  -->
<!-- > *Conclusion:* The results of this study show an improvement in the distance walked and gait speed in amputees $14$ months -->
<!-- after having received a femoral implant. -->

Journal of the American College of Nutrition, 29(4):365–372, 2010. -->




<!-- Background: Wholegrain intake is inversely related to weight gain over time, but little information is -->
<!-- available on the role of pulses in weight control. -->

<!-- Objective: To compare weight loss, metabolic outcomes, and nutrient intakes in obese people assigned to a -->
<!-- diet rich in pulses and wholegrains or a control diet. -->

<!-- Methods: Randomized controlled study of 18 months with 113 volunteers (body mass index [BMI] $\ge$ 28 kg/ -->
<!-- m2). Diets were based on guidelines published by the National Heart Foundation of New Zealand. The -->
<!-- intervention group was advised to consume 2 serves of pulses and 4 serves of wholegrain foods per day as -->
<!-- substitutions for more refined carbohydrates. -->

<!-- Results: Fiber intakes were higher, intakes of several vitamins and minerals were better maintained, and -->
<!-- dietary glycemic index was lower in the intervention compared with the control group. Mean (standard error -->
<!-- [SE]) weight loss at 6 months was 6.0 (0.7) kg and 6.3 (0.6) kg in the control and intervention groups, -->
<!-- respectively, and was not different between groups (p . 0.05). Blood pressure, triglycerides, and glycemic load -->
<!-- were lowered in both groups compared with baseline. Waist circumference was decreased at 18 months in the -->
<!-- intervention compared with the control group (22.8 cm; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.4, 25.1). -->

<!-- Conclusions: Incorporation of pulses and wholegrain foods into a weight loss program resulted in a greater -->
<!-- reduction in waist circumference compared with the group consuming a control diet, although no difference in -->
<!-- weight loss was noted between groups. Retention of several nutrients was better with the pulse and wholegrain -->
<!-- diet. -->

Selected answers are available in Sect.\ \@ref(ReadAnswer).


::: {.exercise #ReadExerciseiPhoneStepCounts}
A research article [@duncan2018walk] examined the accuracy of step counts recorded on iPhones.
The paper records this information about the selection of participants:

> Participants were recruited through word of mouth and posters displayed around the [researcher's] university.
> Participants were eligible if they were ambulatory, $\ge 18$ years of age, and owned an iPhone 6 [...] or newer model.

Although $33$ participants were selected, the authors note some parts of the study used a smaller sample size because one subject lost their phone, while others chose to withdraw from the study.
The paper notes that previous studies have been able to:

> [...] demonstrate the accuracy of the iPhone pedometer function in laboratory test conditions. However, no studies have attempted to evaluate evidence [...] in the field.

The participants completed a hearing test and completed a Hearing Loss Questionnaire (values are between $17$ and $34$:  higher scores indicating more severe hearing loss).

1. What is the population?
1. Critique the sampling method: 
   What is the implication for interpreting the results of the study?
1. Some of the results are presented in 
   Table\ \@ref(tab:HearingLossTable). 
   What statistical test do you think was used to compare the scores for males and females?
1. What are the hypotheses being tested about 'Frequency of use'?
1. Form an approximate $95$% CI for the mean hearing loss score for students who use earphones.

The Abstract from a large study is given below:

> *OBJECTIVE*:
> This study aims to elucidate any existing link between energy-containing liquids, consumed in various forms within the diet, and the effect they may have on body weight or other diseases [...] \smallskip
>
> *METHODS*:
> A self-administered online survey was conducted in $2496$ participants from different countries, in six languages 
> (Spanish, English, Chinese, French, German and Portuguese). 
> Questions referred to their soft drink and water consumption habits, physical exercise performed, presence or absence of certain diseases and medication. \smallskip
> 
> *RESULTS*:
> There is statistically significant difference ($p < 0.001$) in BMI and consumption of cola per week: those who consumed $0$--$3$ cans a week have a lower BMI than those who consume $>7$ cans of cola a week [...] 
> There is greater presence of obesity ($p < 0.001$), gastritis ($p < 0.001$), constipation ($p < 0.001$) and mental illness ($p = 0.003$) among people who drink cola soft drinks. \smallskip
>
> *CONCLUSION*:
> Removal of energy-containing beverages from our diet may be an appropriate public health message to support those interested in preventing weight gain as well as other diseases.
