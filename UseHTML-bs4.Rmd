The book is optimised for *online viewing*,
and the book may be updated frequently,
so a printed PDF version may not be the most recent version.
:::


In some places, interactive 'quiz' questions are given.
*In the online version*, the background turns from red to green when the answer is correct.
Try it now:

1. What is $1 + 1$?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {mcq( c(
   "One", 
   answer = "Two", 
   "Three") )}`
1. What is $1 + 2$?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) {fitb( 
   answer = c("3", "three"), 
   ignore_case = TRUE )}`
1. Is $2 + 2 = 4$?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { torf( TRUE )}`
1. Which one of these is FALSE?
`r if( knitr::is_html_output() ) { 
   longmcq( c("The inventor of the fairy floss machine was a dentist",
              "Barack Obama has won two Grammy awards",
              answer = "Once a year all of Wikipedia is printed, and placed in a vault in Norway.") )}`
