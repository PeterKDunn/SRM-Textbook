# Comparing within individuals {#SummariseWithin}

## Introduction

Sometimes the same variable is measured on each unit of analysis more than once (i.e., *within*-individual comparisons for each unit of analysis) but only a small number of times.
A *case-profile plot* can be used: a plot showing how the response variable changes for each unit of analysis.
Examples of this type of data include:

* Measurements of household water consumption *before* and *after* installing water-saving devices, for many households.
* Blood pressure measurements for many people at $8$am, $1$pm and $8$pm each day.

In both cases, the same variable is measured multiple times for each unit of analysis.


When comparisons are made *within* individuals, different ways are needed for analysiimg the data.
This chapter considers how to compare *qualitative* variables in different groups.
Graphs are very useful this purpose.



## Graphs

When a *quantitative* variable is compared *within* individuals, options for plotting include: 

* Histograms of differences (Sect.\ \@ref(HistoDiffPlot)):
  useful to compare two levels.
* Case-profile plots (Sect.\ \@ref(CaseProfilePlot)): 
  useful when the same units are measured over a small number of time points, or are otherwise connected.
* Time plots (Sect.\ \@ref(TimePlots)):
  a special type of case-profile plot, when the measurements vary over a large number of time points.


### Histogram of differences {#HistoDiffPlot}

Sometimes the same variable is measured on each unit of analysis more than once (i.e., *within*-individual comparisons) but only twice. 
(Within-individuals data that is measured only twice is also called 'paired' data.)
In these cases, a histogram of the *changes* for each individual can be produced.


::: {.example #CaseProfileHistDiffPlots name="Within-individual comparisons"}
A study of children with atopic asthma [@data:Lothian2006:Whey] measured the immunogoblin\ E concentrations (IgE) before and after an intervention for each child (Table\ \@ref(tab:IgEChanges)).
The *reduction* in IgE for each child can be shown using a histogram
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:PairedGraphCaseProfileLATEX), left panel).'
} else {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:PairedGraphCaseProfileHTML), top panel).'

### Case-profile plots {#CaseProfilePlot}

Sometimes the within-individual comparison is made more than two times, and so a histogram of differences cannot be constructed.
In these cases, the values for each individual can be be plotted using a case-profile plot.


::: {.example #CaseProfilePlots name="Within-individual comparisons"}
A study of children with atopic asthma [@data:Lothian2006:Whey] measured the immunogoblin\ E concentrations (IgE) before and after an intervention for each child (Table\ \@ref(tab:IgEChanges)).
The measurements of IgE for each child at both times can be shown using a case-profile plot
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:PairedGraphCaseProfileLATEX), right panel).'
} else {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:PairedGraphCaseProfileHTML), bottom panel).'
}`
Each line corresponds to a unit of analysis (i.e., a child).
:::





::: {.example #GraphPairedData name="Graphing paired data"}
A study [@data:Dawson2017:BirthdayCakes] examined the average number of bacteria on birthday cakes *before* and *after* blowing out the candles.
This RQ could be studied by taking two measurements from each cake: before and after blowing out candles.
The *change* in the number of bacteria could be computed for each cake, and a histogram of the differences plotted.

## Summary tables {#WithinSummaryTables}

The numerical summary information from a within-individuals study can collated in a table, or a *tabular summary*.
The data should be summarised at each within-individual comparison, and (when appropriate) the changes should also be summarised.


```{r IgETable}
IgETable <- array( dim = c(3, 3))

rownames(IgETable) <- c("Before",
                        "After",
                        "Reduction") 
colnames(IgETable) <- c("Mean",
                        "Std, dev.",
                        "Sample size") 


IgETable[, 1] <- round(colMeans(IgE), 1)
IgETable[, 2] <- round(apply(IgE, 2, "sd"), 2)
IgETable[, 3] <- round(apply(IgE, 2, "realLength"), 0)

knitr::kable( surroundMaths(IgETable,
                            decDigits = c(1, 2, 0)),
              format = "latex",
              longtable = FALSE,
              booktabs = TRUE,
              escape = FALSE,
              digits = 1,
              align = c("r", "r", "r", "r"),
              caption = "A numerical summary of the IgE data") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(row = 0, 
           bold = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(row = 3,
           italic = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10)
```
