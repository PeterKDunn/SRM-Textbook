All students in scientific, engineering and health professions need to *read* the research of others; that's how to stay up-to-date with the discipline.
Some students will also need to *write* about their own research or the research of others.
Understanding the language of research is important.


::: {.tipBox .tip data-latex="{iconmonstr-info-6-240.png}"}
In the scientific disciplines, writing *carefully* and *precisely* is crucial:

* Think carefully about every word you use.
  Don't just be understood: avoid being *mis*understood.
* Use the correct, technical words as appropriate (and use them correctly!).
* Write what you mean; and mean what you write.
* Be careful using words with different meanings in science and in every-day use [@richardson2013identification; @dunn2016learning]: Sect. \@ref(LexicalAmbiguity).

<!-- SEM2 2022: Canvas Project Task 2B Group 67 -->
:::{.example #WriteWell name="Write what you mean"}
A student project at my university was titled:

> Driving behaviours: Are dark-coloured car owners more likely to park undercover?

What they really meant was:

> Driving behaviours: Are drivers of dark-coloured cars more likely to park undercover?

Don't just be understood; avoid being *mis*understood!
:::


Formal guidelines for writing and reporting research exist, for experimental ([CONSORT](http://www.consort-statement.org/)) and observational studies ([STROBE](https://www.strobe-statement.org)), though we will not delve into these specifically.

<!-- Some information in this chapter is based on Dr. Michael Lufaso's notes (http://www.unf.edu/~michael.lufaso/chem4931/lecture3.pdf) and Prof. Tony Roberts (http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/anthony.roberts/LaTeX/ltxwrite.php) notes. -->


## General tips

A series of experimental studies concluded that students often believe that using fancy words makes them sound smarter [@oppenheimer2006consequences].
One conclusion of the research was that using 'fancy' language *does not work*: '*needless* complexity leads to negative evaluations...' (@oppenheimer2006consequences, p. 151; emphasis added).
Of course, use the fancy word if that is the best word and the correct word.
One recommendation by the author is to

> ... write clearly and simply if you can, and you'll be more likely to be thought of as intelligent.
>
> --- @oppenheimer2006consequences, p. 153

With this in mind, scientific writing:

* **Should** use simple, clear but technically correct language.
* **Should** present the facts in an unbiased manner.
* **Should** be clear, concise and complete.
* **Should** use facts to make statements.
* **Should** be complete enough that other professionals can repeat the study.
* **Should not** be haphazard, jumbled or illogical. 
* **Should not** be used as a personal soapbox.
* **Should not** reach conclusions that are not based on the given evidence.
* **Should not** overstate what has been learnt from the study.



## Article structure

Many scientific papers have these (or similar) sections, though it varies by discipline:

* Title and authors.
* **A**bstract: 
  A summary of the whole paper, without details.
* **I**ntroduction: 
  *Why* was the study done, and *what* was hoping to be achieved?
* **M**aterials and method: *How* was the study done?
* **R**esults: What was found?
* **D**iscussion (or Summary, or Conclusions): What does it *mean*?
* References (or Bibliography).

Often the acronym AIMRaD or IMRaD is used to remember these sections.
These components capture the six-step research process in this book (Fig. \@ref(fig:ReportStructure)).

### Titles {#WritingTitles}

Titles are important: they can easily discourage a reader from engaging with an article.
A title should be a clear description of the main purpose of the article, and "never be dull" [@PeatWriting, p. 93].
Titles sometimes pose questions ('Does asthma reduce linear growth?') or answer questions ('Linear growth deficit in asthmatic children'; @PeatWriting, p. 98).


::: {.example #ArticleTitles name="Article title"}
A good example of a title is:

> Beauty sleep: experimental study on the perceived health and attractiveness of sleep deprived people
>
> --- @data:axelsson:beautysleep

A *poor* example of an article title is:

> The nucleotide sequence of a 3.2 kb segment of mitochondrial maxicircle DNA from Crithidia fasciculata containing the gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit III, the N-terminal part of the apocytochrome b gene and a possible frameshift gene; further evidence for the use of unusual initiator triplets in trypanosome mitochondria
> 
> --- @sloof1987nucleotide

A *very* poor example of an article title is:

> Reaction of a bidentate ligands (4,4'-dimethyl 2,2'-bipyridine) with planar-chiral chloro-bridged ruthenium: Synthesis of cis-dicarbonyl[4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine- $\kappa$ O1, $\kappa$ O2] $\lbrace$ 2-[tricarbonyl($\eta$ 6-phenylene- $\kappa$ C1)chromium]pyridine- $\kappa$N $\rbrace$ ruthenium hexafluorophosphate

### Abstract {#WritingAbstract}

The Abstract is a short section at the start of an article summarising the *whole* paper, including the results; it is *not* an introduction!
The Abstract is often the most important part of any article, as it is all that many people will read.
Writing the Abstract after the paper is fully written is often sensible.
Some (but not all) journals require a *structured abstract*, where the Abstract contains sections (see Sect. \@ref(ReadExample1)).
These abstracts are usually much easier for a reader to follow.

The Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) statement [@cohen2017stard] list *essential* items for Abstracts; these are (slightly adapted):

*  *Background and Objectives*:
   List the study objectives (the RQ).
* *Methods*: Describe:
  - The process of *data collection*; 
  - The *type* of study;
  - The *inclusion and exclusion criteria* for individuals;
  - The *settings* in which the data were collected;
  - The *sampling* method (e.g., random or convenience sample);
  - The tools or methods used to *collect the data*.
* *Results*: Provide
  - The number of individuals in all groups included in the analysis;
  - Estimates of precision of estimates (e.g., confidence intervals);
  - Results of analysis (e.g., hypothesis tests).
* *Discussion*: Provide
  - A general *interpretation* of the results;
  - *Implications* for practice, including the intended use of the index test;
  - Limitations of the study.

These loosely align with the six steps of research used in this book.


::: {.example #StructuredAbstract name="Structured abstract"}
A research study examined the long-term effects of mortality after amputation [@data:Singh:lowerlimb].
The (structured) Abstract (slightly edited for brevity) is given below:

> *Background*: 
> Mortality after amputation is known to be extremely high and is associated with a number of patient features. 
> We wished to calculate this mortality after first-time lower-limb amputation and investigate whether any population or treatment factors are associated with worse mortality.\smallskip
>
> *Objective*: 
> To follow up individuals after lower limb amputation and ascertain the mortality rate as well as population or treatment features associated with mortality.\smallskip
>
> *Study design*: A prospective cohort study [i.e., a study with forward direction]\smallskip
>
> *Methods*: Prospective lower-limb amputations over 1 year ($N = 105$) at a Regional Rehabilitation Centre were followed up for 3 years.\smallskip
>
> *Results*: 
> After 3 years, 35 individuals in the cohort had died, representing a mortality of 33%. 
> On initial univariate analysis, those who died were more likely to have diabetes mellitus ($\chi^2 = 7.16$, $\text{df} = 1$, $p = 0.007$) and less likely to have been fitted with a prosthesis ($\chi^2 =5.84$, $\text{df}=1$, $p=0.016$) [...]
> Diabetes (odds ratio${} = 3.04$, confidence intervals${} = 1.25$4--$7.40$, $p = 0.014$) and absence of prosthesis-fitting (odds ratio${} = 2.60$, confidence interval${} = 1.16$--$6.25$, $p = 0.028$) were independent predictors of mortality.\smallskip
>
> *Conclusion*: Mortality after amputation is extremely high and is increased in individuals with diabetes or in those who are not fitted with a prosthesis after amputation.

### Introduction {#WritingIntroduction}

The purpose of the introduction is to:

1. Gain the interest of readers, and encourage them to read more of the article.
1. Establish the context and background.
1. Define the language and definitions used in the study.
1. Introduce the theoretical groundwork of the subject.
1. State the purpose of the paper: Why it was written, and what the authors hope to learn.
1. Show how the research fills a gap in existing knowledge.

The introduction often includes a literature review too, though sometimes a literature review is a separate section.


### Materials and methods {#WritingMethods}

The Materials and Methods section (sometimes just called Methods) explains how the data were obtained:

* How the *sample* was obtained.
* How the data were *collected* (the data collection *protocol*).
* How the data were *analysed* (including the software used, and the statistical methods used).
* What specialized equipment was used (don't list pencils, rulers, paper, etc.!).


### Results {#WritingResults}

The Results summarise the conclusions from the data, especially regarding the initial RQ.
The Results section:

* Shows all the relevant findings from the research.
* Presents a summary of the data: the number of observations, the number of missing values, and a verbal description of all variables.
  Unless the dataset is small, the data itself is usually not given (though may appear in an Appendix or online supplement).
* Presents tabular, numerical and/or graphical summaries of the data and relationships of importance.
* Gives a brief verbal interpretation of these summaries.
* Gives the *results* from any hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.
* Identifies trends, consistencies, anomalies, etc.
* Does *not* interpret or explain the results (that is the purpose of the Discussion).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Output from software may have to be sensibly rounded before being included in a report (including in tables and graphs).
Cutting-and-pasting software output into reports is never acceptable, except for graphs.
:::



### Discussion and conclusion {#WritingDiscussion}

Sometimes, articles have *separate* Discussion and Conclusion sections; sometimes they are combined.
The Discussion section:

* Summarises the results.
* Gives a short evaluation of the results.
* Answers the stated RQ.
* Discusses limitations (Sect. \@ref(Interpretation)), strengths, weaknesses, problems, challenges.
* Tries to anticipate and respond to potential questions about the research.

Readers should reach the conclusions based on the *evidence* presented.


### Lexically ambiguous words {#LexicalAmbiguity}


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/writing-828911_1920.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


Writing *carefully* and *precisely* is incredibly important.
One aspect of writing well is selecting the best word to use, especially when many words have a different meaning in other scientific disciplines, or compared to every-day use (*lexical ambiguity*; @richardson2013identification; @dunn2016learning).
If you are unsure of the definitions used in this book, use the Glossary (Appendix \@ref(Glossary)).
Some specific examples include:

* **Average**: In research, 'average' can refers to *any* way of measuring the typical value (Sect. \@ref(ComputeAverage)), including the mean and the median, but also other measures too.
  Use the specific word 'mean' or 'median' if that is what you actually intend!
* **Confidence**: In research, 'confidence' is usually used in the phrase 'confidence interval', where it has a specific meaning (Sect. \@ref(CIInterpretation)).
* **Comparison**: In research, a 'comparison' (Sect. \@ref(Comparison)) is when the sample and population can be separated into two or more groups that are either treated differently (e.g., one group is given a placebo, and one a treatment) or are fundamentally different (e.g., aged under 40, or aged 40 or over).
* **Control**: In research, a 'control' refers to a specific situation, and is helpful for maximising internal validity (Def. \@ref(def:Control)).
* **Correlation**: In research, correlation describes the relationship between two *quantitative* variables (Sect. \@ref(CorrCoefficients)).
* **Estimate**: In research, 'estimating' usually means to find a sample value (i.e., to make a calculation) to estimate an unknown population parameter, rather than the colloquial use where it often means to take a wild guess (Sect. \@ref(TwoApproaches)).
* **Experiment**: In research, an experiment is a specific type of research study (Sect. \@ref(ExperimentalStudies)). 
  Use the word 'study' to talk about experimental and observational studies more generally. 
* **Graph**: In research, a 'graph' is used to summarise data (Chap. \@ref(Graphs)).
* **Independent**: This words has *many* uses in statistics and research, in science, and in general use. 
  The word 'independent' in this book refers to events that do not impact each other in a probabilistic sense (Sect. \@ref(Independence)).
* **Intervention**: In research, an 'intervention' (Sect. \@ref(Intervention)) is how the researchers manipulate the comparison or connection.
* **Normal**: In research, 'normal' usually refers to the 'normal distribution' (Chap. \@ref(NormalDistribution)).
  If this is *not* the meaning you intend to convey, consider using the word 'usual'.
* **Odds**: In research, 'odds' has a specific meaning (Sect. \@ref(QualOdds)) and is *different* that probability, whereas 'probability' and 'odds' are often used interchangeably in general usage.
* **Population**: In research, the 'population' refers to a larger group of interest (Sect. \@ref(Population)), whereas in general use 'population' usually refers to groups of people.
* **Random**: In research, 'random' has a specific meaning, but in general usage it often means 'haphazard'.
* **Regression**: In research, 'regression' refers to the mathematical relationship between two quantitative variables (Sect. \@ref(Regression)). 
* **Sample**: In research, we say (for example) that we 'have taken one sample of 30 fungi' (Sect. \@ref(IdeaOfSampling)); in some disciplines, this could be described as 'taking 30 samples'.
* **Significant**: This is perhaps the most mis-used word in scientific writing. 
  In research, 'significance' is usually understood to refer to 'statistical significance' (Sect. \@ref(AboutPvalues)).
  If this is *not* the meaning you intend to convey, consider using the word 'substantial'.
* **Variable**: In research, a 'variable' is something that can vary from individual to individual (Def. \@ref(def:Variable)).

Some *symbols* may also have different meanings in research than in some other scientific disciplines; again, care is needed when using these symbols:

* $\beta$: In this book, $\beta$ refers to the regression parameters (Sect. \@ref(Regression-Software)).
* $\rho$: In this book, $\rho$ refers to the population correlation coefficient (Sect. \@ref(CorrCoefficients)).
* $\pm$: In this book, the symbol $\pm$ is used for confidence intervals to describe a *range* of values in which the population parameter probably lies (Sect. \@ref(AboutCIs)).


<!-- ## Constructing tables -->

<!-- Good tables can be time-consuming to construct. -->
<!-- In general, tables: -->

<!-- * **Should** be discussed (not just simply presented) in the text. -->
<!-- * **Should** be clear and uncluttered (consider using multiple tables if necessary). -->
<!-- * **Should** typically have captions *above*. -->

### Constructing tables and graphs {#WritingGraphsTables}

Good figures and tables take time and care.
Their purpose should always be to *display the data in the simplest, clearest possible way*.
In general, tables and graphs:

* **Should** be discussed (not just presented) in the text.
* **Should** be clear and uncluttered.
* **Should** includes units of measurement (such as kg) where appropriate.
* **Should** be able to be understood without reference to the paper, as far as possible.
* **Should** use easy-to-read fonts and colours:
  Make sure the writing is sufficiently large when placed in the article.
* **Should** have any colours, different line types or different fonts explained if they have a purpose.
  (If they do not have a purpose, consider removing them.)
* **Should not** include *chart junk* (such as artificial third dimensions for graphs [@su2008s], and unnecessary lines in tables).

Figures typically have captions *below*, while tables typically have captions *above*.


### Other elements {#WritingOther}

Many research articles have other sections too:

* **References**
  - Give the full citations of any work referenced, in the required format (such as APA, Harvard, etc.).
  - Organise and format references correctly: Many disciplines or journals have strict guidelines for how references must be listed and formatted.
    
* **Acknowledgements**:
  Thank people who legitimately contributed to the report, and research funding bodies.
  One study [@allen2019can] identified many different ways in which people can contribute: see, for example, https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement
  
* **Appendices**
   - The appendices contain important material that would break the flow of the article's narrative.
   - Appendices may include large tables, images, detailed discussions of technical details, ...
   - Sometimes, appendices are placed online.


## Style

Different disciplines and journals have their own styles; read articles from your discipline or target journal to see how to write in the required style.
Some general style recommendations include:

* Use short sentences.
* Use inclusive language (e.g., 'fire-fighter' rather than 'fireman').
* Omit words, phrases, sentences that add nothing to the paper.
* Ensure correct content, grammar, spelling, punctuation, format.
* Check for commonly misused words: there/their; your/you're; affect/effect; chose/choose; etc.
* Ensure capitalisation is correct.
* Use apostrophes (**not** apostrophe's!) correctly.
* Crucially, be unambiguous: Sentences should say what they mean, and should mean what they say:
* Use, but do not rely upon, the spell checker.

::: {.example #ShortSentences name="Short sentences"}
The first sentence should be accessible and engaging. 
Here is a very poor first sentence:
  
> Until recently, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), conventionally defined in the pediatric literature as a syndrome of the triad of renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia without a prodrome of hemorrhagic diarrhea, has received little attention in adult practice because the patients are commonly given the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or TTP/HUS and treated as TTP with plasma exchange, augmented in refractory cases with rituximab and sometimes even splenectomy.

::: {.example #WriteCarefully name="Writing carefully"}
This sentence appeared in a published article [@PsychologyMysore]:

> 600 teachers, from both Government and Private Schools, have been *drowned* by random sampling.
>
> --- @PsychologyMysore, p. 14; emphasis added

This sentence is poor: No-one has ever been *drowned* by random sampling.
Possibly, the authors mean that teachers were 'overwhelmed by participation in many research studies'.
However, later the article states:

> Using random sampling a total number of 600 teachers were selected from...
>
> --- @PsychologyMysore, p. 17

So the initial wording is *wrong*, and I suspect the sample probably wasn't *random* either!
:::


## Plagiarism {#Plagiarism}

Research refers to using other people's ideas and research to develop new conclusions or confirm existing conclusion, without acknowledgement.
The *Macquarie Dictionary* defines plagiarism as

> the appropriation or imitation of another's ideas and manner of expressing them, as in art, literature, etc., to be passed off as one's own.
>
> --- *The Macquarie Dictionary*: https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/

To avoid plagiarism, all sources used when writing research should be acknowledged.
Plagiarism is a serious offence: theft of intellectual property.
**Do not plagiarise**; use quotes if necessary and cite work (sparingly).
Plagiarism does not just apply to words and text; it also applies to images, ideas, etc.


::: {.example #PlagiarismEG name="Plagiarism"}
The *Indian Journal of Dermatology* published an article to discourage plagiarism [@shamim2014development].
Unfortunately, the [article was retracted](http://www.e-ijd.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5154;year=2014;volume=59;issue=5;spage=473;epage=475;aulast=Shamim) because parts of the article were plagiarised.

<!-- ## Final comments -->

<!-- Finally, excellent advice, with a humorous slant, appears [on the offical *plain language* website of the US government](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/humor/how-to-write-good/), including these gems: -->

<!-- * Avoid Alliteration. Always. -->
<!-- * Prepositions are not words to end sentences with. -->
<!-- * Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat.) -->
<!-- * Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc. -->
<!-- * Contractions aren't necessary. -->
<!-- * One should never generalize. -->
<!-- * Be more or less specific. -->
<!-- * Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement. -->
<!-- * Don't repeat yourself, or say again what you have said before. -->
<!-- * Don't use commas, that, are not, necessary. -->
<!-- * Never use a big word when a diminutive alternative would suffice. -->
<!-- * Use youre spell chekker to avoid mispeling and to catch typograhpical errers. -->
<!-- * Use the apostrophe in it's proper place and omit it when its not needed. -->
<!-- * If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing. -->

The two variables observed on each person in the study were whether or not the person used a disposable cup, and the sex of the person.
In reporting the results in their Abstract, the students state:
  
> Based on the sample results, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean number of disposable cups used by males and females is between  0.690 and 1.625. Meaning  that the population mean is likely to fall between those two intervals.

A study [@data:Baughman2007:SixMinuteWalk] gave this information:

> The aim of our study was to determine the range of 6MWD [6-minute walk distance] in an unselected group of sarcoidosis patients.
> We performed a prospective study [i.e., forward direction] of sarcoidosis patients followed up in one tertiary sarcoidosis clinic.
