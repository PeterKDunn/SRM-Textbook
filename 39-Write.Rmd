Research needs to be effectively communicated and shared so the results can be used by others.
The purpose of writing about research is to effectively and clearly communicate.
TESTME F and M.
And also USA.
And also RQ@. . . . . 
And also RQ@. . . . .  

Research may be shared using face-to-face or online presentations (Sect.\ \@ref(PreparingPresentations)) or written documents (Sect.\ \@ref(WritingDocuments)).
The style and expectations vary widely between these two formats, and also between disciplines (even journals in the same discipline can have different expectations).
Hence, in this chapter, general comments are made about writing about research, rather than giving specific requirements.
Formal guidelines for writing and reporting research exist, for both experimental studies [@hopewell2022update] and observational studies [@von2007strengthening], though we will not discuss these specifically.


## General advice {#WritingGeneralTips}

The purpose of writing about research is to effectively and clearly communicate the research.
In the scientific disciplines, writing *carefully* and *precisely* is important: using the correct words appropriately is crucial.
Think carefully about every word you use to ensure it conveys the correct and intended meaning.
With this in mind, all scientific writing:


:::::: {.cols data-latex="[T]"}

::: {.col data-latex="{0.50\textwidth}"}

* *should* use inclusive language (e.g., 'fire-fighter', not 'fireman').
* *should* avoid ambiguity.
* *should* use terminology consistently.
* *should* use simple, clear but technically-correct language.
* *should* present the facts in an unbiased manner.
* *should* be clear, concise and complete.
* *should* avoid unnecessary repetition.

:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.06\textwidth}"}
\ 
<!-- an empty Div (with a white space), serving as
a column separator -->
:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.42\textwidth}"}

* *should not* contain unnecessary words and phrases.
* *should not* be haphazard, jumbled or makes leaps of logic.
* *should not* promote personal opinions (such as describing results as 'exciting', and so on).
* *should not* reach conclusions unsupported by the given evidence.
* *should not* overstate what has been learnt from the study.

:::
::::::


Because academic writing avoids personal opinions, writing in first person ('I applied the fertiliser') is usually (but not always) preferred over writing in third person ('the fertiliser was applied').


::: {.example #Overstating name="Overstating conclusions"}
A student project found that the proportion of provisional drivers (those yet to get a full open licence) was higher in free university car parks, compared to paid university car parks.
They concluded that provisional drivers seek to 'save money by parking in free carparks'.

This *may* be true, but the evidence from their *observational* study cannot demonstrate this.
For example, the proportion may be higher in the free car parks as those car parks may be closer to their classrooms.
The study simply shows evidence of a difference in proportions, but does not study *why*.
To learn the reason, provisional drivers could be surveyed.
:::


Ensure correct spelling, grammar, punctuation and formatting, and use (but do not rely upon) a spell checker and grammar checker.
Specifically:

* Ensure that do *not* confuse using commonly-confused words (there/their; your/you're; affect/effect; chose/choose; etc.).
  Use a dictionary!
* Capitalise correctly
* Use apostrophes correctly. 
  For example, "it's" is only ever an abbreviation for "it is"; be careful with plurals.
* Take care using comparative terms.
  For example, stating that 'there is evidence that this treatment is *better*' must be clarified; better than *what*, and in what sense (cost? ease of use? patient outcomes?).
* Ensure verbs and subjects agree. 
  For example, 'a group *was*' rather than 'a group *were*'; 'the sample *was*' rather than 'the sample *were*'.
  In many cases, 'data' is used as a plural ('datum' is the singular; 'dataset' is also singular); that is, we write 'the data *were* right skewed' rather than 'the data *was* right skewed', but the latter use is becoming more common.

After completing a first draft, revise your document carefully as many times as necessary.
Writing well is difficult; editing can be painful.
Having someone else read and comment on your writing can be useful.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
William Howard Taft (27th president of the United States) is claimed to have said (emphasis added): 

> Don't write so that you *can* be understood; write so that you *can't* be misunderstood.

Be unambiguous: say what you mean, and mean what you say.

:::





<!-- SEM2 2022: Canvas Project Task 2B Group 67 -->
:::{.example #WriteWell name="Write what you mean"}
A student project at my university asked:

> Are dark-coloured car owners more likely to park undercover?

They actually meant:

> Are drivers of dark-coloured cars more likely to park undercover?

Don't just be understood; avoid being *mis*understood!
:::


A series of experimental studies [@oppenheimer2006consequences] concluded that students often believe that the use of fancy words makes them appear smarter.
However, one conclusion of the research was that using 'fancy' language *does not* achieve this: '*needless* complexity leads to negative evaluations...' (@oppenheimer2006consequences, p.\ 151; emphasis added).
Always use the best, most appropriate and technically-correct word.
One recommendation from the study is to (p.\ 153):

> ... write clearly and simply if you can, and you'll be more likely to be thought of as intelligent.

<!-- ::: {.example #ShortSentences name="Short sentences"} -->
<!-- The first sentence should be accessible and engaging.  -->
<!-- Here is a very poor first sentence: -->

<!-- > Until recently, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), conventionally defined in the pediatric literature as a syndrome of the triad of renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia without a prodrome of hemorrhagic diarrhoea, has received little attention in adult practice because the patients are commonly given the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or TTP/HUS and treated as TTP with plasma exchange, augmented in refractory cases with rituximab and sometimes even splenectomy. -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > --- @tsai2014mechanistic, p. 187 -->
<!-- ::: -->


<!-- ::: {.example #WriteCarefully name="Writing carefully"} -->
<!-- This sentence appeared in a published article (@PsychologyMysore, p. 14; emphasis added): -->

<!-- > 600 teachers, from both Government and Private Schools, have been *drowned* by random sampling. -->


<!-- This sentence is poor: no-one has ever been *drowned* by random sampling. -->
<!-- Possibly, the authors mean that teachers were '*overwhelmed* by participation in many research studies'. -->
<!-- However, later the article states: "Using random sampling a total number of $600$ teachers were selected..." (p. 17), so the initial wording is *wrong*, and I suspect the sample probably wasn't *random* either! -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- Finally, excellent advice, with a humorous slant, appears [on the offical *plain language* website of the US government](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/humor/how-to-write-good/), including these gems: -->

<!-- * Avoid Alliteration. Always. -->
<!-- * Prepositions are not words to end sentences with. -->
<!-- * Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat.) -->
<!-- * Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc. -->
<!-- * Contractions aren't necessary. -->
<!-- * One should never generalize. -->
<!-- * Be more or less specific. -->
<!-- * Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement. -->
<!-- * Don't repeat yourself, or say again what you have said before. -->
<!-- * Don't use commas, that, are not, necessary. -->
<!-- * Never use a big word when a diminutive alternative would suffice. -->
<!-- * Use youre spell chekker to avoid mispeling and to catch typograhpical errers. -->
<!-- * Use the apostrophe in it's proper place and omit it when its not needed. -->
<!-- * If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing. -->

Different disciplines and journals have their own styles; read articles from your discipline or target journal to see how to write in the required style.


## Preparing presentations {#PreparingPresentations}

*Presentations* are often used to share progress reports of research, or give an overview of completed research.
They are often used at conferences, workshops, and progress meetings.
Presentations are often given to peers, stakeholders, funding bodies, small groups of other researchers, or work teams.
Presentations should be adapted to suit the time allocated and the target audience: a conference presentation to a group of your research peers should be different than a presentation to a progress meeting.

Presentations are mostly a *verbal* (speaking) and *visual* (preparing slides) medium.

As an *verbal* medium, speak slowly, clearly, loudly, and with expression.
Use eye contact, and practice!
Ensure you keep to your allocated time.
Ensure technical or unusual words are pronounced correctly; the correct pronunciation of many unfamiliar terms have been given in this book. 

As a *visual* medium, presentations usually omit technical details and give the audience an overview of the major points; sharing technical details in a presentation is unlikely to produce an engaging presentation. 
Presentations tend to focus on the *why* and the *what* of the research, and a brief overview of *how*.
They may encourage audience members to learn more by reading your written documents (Sect.\ \@ref(WritingDocuments)).

Presentations also tend to use graphs, images, short sentences, and minimal text.
Presentation software encourages the use of fancy fonts, transitions and animations, but these are usually more distracting than informative; avoid.
Ensure your fonts are colours are readable from a distance (especially for tables and graphs).

Using bullet points on slides, while common, is not necessary; short sentences are fine.
Slides should *not* contain information that you simply *read* to the audience; a good presenter adds important details around the structure provided by information on the slides.
The slides *guide*, but do not have to *tell*, your story of your research.


## Writing documents {#WritingDocuments}

Written documents are more likely to be formally written and prepared than presentations, and generally to contain details omitted in presentations.
Unlike presentations, written documents usually provide details of *how* the research was conducted.
Written documents may be journal articles, progress reports, reports to stakeholders, or funding applications.
In what follows, all these types of written documents are referred to as 'articles' for brevity.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Journal articles, and sometimes other written documents too, should contain sufficient details so that other professionals can repeat the study (Chap.\ \@ref(Protocols)).
:::



### Article titles {#WritingTitles}

Titles are important: poor titles can  discourage a reader from reading an article.
A title should clearly describe the main purpose of the article.
Sometimes this is achieved by pose questions in the title ('Do warning lights and sirens reduce ambulance response times?'; @data:Brown2000:WarningLights) or providing answers in the title ('No harm from five year ingestion of oats in coeliac disease'; @data:Janatuinen2002:Coeliac).

Try to avoid overly-specific technical language and uncommon abbreviations in the title.


<!-- ::: {.example #ArticleTitles name="Article title"} -->
<!-- A example of a good title is: -->

<!-- > Beauty sleep: experimental study on the perceived health and attractiveness of sleep deprived people -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > --- @data:axelsson:beautysleep -->

<!-- A example of a poor article title is: -->

<!-- > The nucleotide sequence of a 3.2 kb segment of mitochondrial maxicircle DNA from Crithidia fasciculata containing the gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit III, the N-terminal part of the apocytochrome b gene and a possible frameshift gene; further evidence for the use of unusual initiator triplets in trypanosome mitochondria -->
<!-- >  -->
<!-- > --- @sloof1987nucleotide -->
<!-- ::: -->



### Authors {#WritingAuthors}

Ensure that everyone who has made an intellectual contribution is listed as an author.
This is ethical practice (Sect.\ \@ref(Ethics))\index{Ethics}, and includes (see @brand2015beyond) those who helped with:


:::::: {.cols data-latex=""}
::: {.col data-latex="{0.27\textwidth}"}

* conceptualisation.
* methodology.
* software.
* data analysis.

* creating images or taking photographs.
* writing, including writing drafts, reviewing and editing.
* visualization.
* supervision.
* project administration.
* funding acquisition.

:::
::::::


### Abstract {#WritingAbstract}

The *Abstract* is a short section at the start of an article summarising the *whole* paper, including the results; it is *not* an introduction!
The *Abstract* is often the most important part of any article, as it is the only part that many people will read.
Some (but not all) journals require a *structured abstract*, where the *Abstract* contains specific headings.

The Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) statement [@cohen2017stard] list *essential* items for *Abstracts* (slightly adapted), whether they are structured or not:

*  *Background and Objectives*:
   List the study objectives (or the RQ@. . . . . , or the Aims, as necessary).
* *Methods*: Describe:
  - the process of *data collection*.
  - the *type* of study.
  - the *inclusion and exclusion criteria* for individuals.
  - the *settings* in which the data were collected.
  - the *sampling* method (e.g., systematic or convenience sample).
  - the tools or methods used to *collect the data*.
* *Results*: Provide:
  - the number of individuals in all groups included in the analysis.
  - estimates of precision of estimates (e.g., confidence intervals).
  - results of analysis (e.g., hypothesis tests).
* *Discussion*: Provide:
  - a general *interpretation* of the results.
  - *implications* for practice.
  - *limitations* of the study.

All of these components are studied in this book.


::: {.example #StructuredAbstract name="Structured abstract"}
@data:Singh:lowerlimb examined the long-term effects of mortality after lower-limb amputation.
Here is the structured *Abstract*, slightly edited for brevity, which contains most of the required elements (p.\ 545):

> *Background*: 
> Mortality after amputation is known to be extremely high and is associated with a number of patient features. 
> We wished to calculate this mortality after first-time lower-limb amputation and investigate whether any population or treatment factors are associated with worse mortality.\smallskip
>
> *Objective*: 
> To follow up individuals after lower limb amputation and ascertain the mortality rate as well as population or treatment features associated with mortality.\smallskip
>
> *Study design*: A prospective cohort study [i.e., a forward direction study]\index{Study types!directionality!forward}
\smallskip
>
> *Methods*: Prospective lower-limb amputations over 1 year ($N = 105$) at a Regional Rehabilitation Centre were followed up for $3$ years.\smallskip
>
> *Results*: 
> After $3$ years, $35$ individuals in the cohort had died, representing a mortality of $33$%. 
> On initial univariate analysis, those who died were more likely to have diabetes mellitus ($\chi^2 = 7.16$, $\text{df} = 1$, $p = 0.007$) [...]
> Diabetes (odds ratio${} = 3.04$,\index{Odds} confidence interval ${} = 1.25$--$7.40$, $p = 0.014$) [was an] independent predictor of mortality....\smallskip
>
> *Conclusion*: Mortality after amputation is extremely high and is increased in individuals with diabetes...
:::


### Introduction {#WritingIntroduction}

The purpose of the *Introduction* is to:

* gain the interest of readers, and encourage them to read more of the article.
* establish the context and background.
* define the language, acronyms and definitions used in the study.
* introduce the theoretical groundwork of the subject.
* state the purpose of the paper: why it was written, and what the authors hope to learn.

The *Introduction* should also show how the research fills a gap in existing knowledge, by using a literature review; sometimes a literature review is a separate section.


### Methods {#WritingMethods}

The *Methods* section (sometimes called *Materials and Methods* or similar) explains how the data were obtained; for example:

* how the *sample* was identified and located.
* how the data were *collected* from the individuals (the data collection *protocol*).\index{Protocol}
* how external and internal validity was maximised, and confounding managed;
* how the data were *analysed*, including the software\index{Software} (and version number) used, and the statistical methods used.
* what specialized equipment was used (don't list pencils, rulers, paper, etc.).


### Results {#WritingResults}

The *Results* summarise the conclusions from the analysis, especially regarding the initial RQ@. . . . . 
The *Results* section:

* shows all the relevant findings from the research.
* presents a summary of the data: the number of observations, the number of missing values, and a verbal description of important variables.
* presents tabular, numerical and/or graphical summaries of the data and relationships of importance.
* gives a brief verbal interpretation of these summaries.
* gives the results from any hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.
* identifies trends, consistencies, anomalies, etc.
* does *not* provide interpretations or explanations of the results (that is the purpose of the *Discussion*).

Unless the dataset is small, the data itself is usually not given (though may appear in an Appendix or online).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Cutting-and-pasting software output into reports is rarely acceptable, except for carefully-prepared graphs (Chap.\ \@ref(SummariseComments); Sect.\ \@ref(WritingGraphsTables)).
:::



### Discussion {#WritingDiscussion}

Sometimes, articles have separate *Conclusion* and *Discussion* sections; sometimes they are combined.
No new information should be presented in this section.
This section:

* summarises the results.
* gives a short evaluation of the results.
* answers the stated RQ@. . . . . 
* discusses limitations (Chap.\ \@ref(Interpretation)), strengths, weaknesses, problems, challenges.
* tries to anticipate and respond to potential questions about the research.

Readers should reach the conclusions based on the *evidence* presented.



### Referencing {#Referencing}
\index{Plagiarism}

Writing about research almost always refers to, and builds on, other people's work to formulate the research question, establish ideas and explain the background of the research.
However, *plagiarism* (using other people's words and ideas without acknowledgement) should be avoided.
All sources used when writing research should be acknowledged.
Plagiarism is a serious offence: it is theft of intellectual property.
*Do not plagiarise*; use quotes if necessary and cite work (sparingly).
Plagiarism applies to words, text, images, photographs, ideas, etc.


::: {.example #PlagiarismEG name="Plagiarism"}
@shamim2014development published an article to discourage plagiarism.
Later, the 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'article was retracted'
} else {
   '[article was retracted](http://www.e-ijd.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5154;year=2014;volume=59;issue=5;spage=473;epage=475;aulast=Shamim)'
}`
because parts of the article were plagiarised.
:::

<!-- ::: {.example #EthicsSarkar name="Plagiarism"} -->
<!-- A microbiologist had articles retracted due to fraud, including self-plagiarism and reusing figures that were claimed to come from different studies (@Chatterjee2015, p.\ 1527). -->
<!-- ::: -->




The *References* (or *Bibliography*) section gives the full citations of any work referenced, in the required format (such as APA, Harvard, etc.).
This is ethical practice.
Most journals have strict guidelines for how references should be listed and formatted.
    

### Optional sections {#WritingOther}

Sometimes an *Acknowledgements* section is used to  thank and acknowledge other contributions, such as people who legitimately contributed to the manuscript, and research funding bodies.
Avoid saying 'The authors would like to thank...'; instead, directly thank them: 'We thank...'.
Reviewers of the article (who are almost always volunteers) are usually thanked also.

Often an *Appendix* is included, which contains important material that would otherwise break the flow of the article's narrative.
The *Appendix* may include large tables, data, images, discussions of technical details, mathematical development, and so on.
Sometimes, this material is placed online.


### Article structure

Articles are usually expected to have a more formal structure than presentations, as noted above.
Sometimes the acronym AIMRaD or IMRaD is used to remember these sections:

* ***A**bstract*,
* ***I**ntroduction*,
* ***M**ethods*,
* ***R**esults*, and 
* ***D**iscussion* (or *Summary*, or *Conclusions*).

These components capture the six-step research process in this book (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ReportStructure)).


```{r ReportStructure, fig.cap="The connection between the paper and the steps we have studied. The Abstract briefly covers all aspects of the study, and the Discussion explains what has been learnt through the process.", fig.align="center", fig.width=5.5, out.width='65%'}
source("R/showAIMRAD.R")  
showAIMRAD(debug = FALSE)
```


## Specific advice {#WriteSpecificAdvice}

### Constructing tables, graphs and images {#WritingGraphsTables}
\index{Tables!preparing}\index{Graphs!preparing}

Good figures and tables take time and care to prepare (Chap.\ \@ref(SummariseComments)).
Their purpose should always be to *display the data in the simplest, clearest possible way*, and should be produced to display the important information of interest.
In general, tables, graphs and images:

* *should* be discussed (not just presented) and referred to in the text.
* *should* be clear and uncluttered.
* *should* include units of measurement (such as kg) where appropriate.
* *should* be able to be understood without reference to the paper, as far as possible.
* *should* use easy-to-read fonts and colours: for example, ensure the font size is sufficiently large when placed in the final article.
* *should* avoid using different colours, line types or fonts unless these have a purpose (i.e., to differentiate between groups in the study); if they are used, their purpose should be explained (e.., using a figure legend).
* *should not* include *chart junk* (such as artificial third dimensions for graphs (Sect.\ \@ref(GraphsConstructing)), and unnecessary lines in tables).

Figures and images typically have captions *below*, while tables typically have captions *above*.
The source of all images (e.g., the photographer) should be acknowledged, when appropriate.
Table should use very few horizontal lines, and no vertical lines.


### Presenting numbers

When presenting numbers, ensure all figures are rounded appropriately.
Software may report more decimal places than necessary, for instance.
When appropriate, ensure units of measurement are given.

Be consistent and careful with decimal numbers.
Some journals require numbers to be written with a leading zero, and some do not.
For example, some require writing $P = 0.024$ and some $P = .024$.

Counts are usually written in words (i.e., 'three') when less than ten (or sometimes twelve), and otherwise presented using digits ('12\ 041').
However, numbers are written in full when starting a sentence ('Thirty-seven people volunteered').



::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Numbers taken from software output may need to be sensibly rounded before being included in a report (including in tables and graphs).
:::



### Lexically ambiguous words {#LexicalAmbiguity}


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/writing-828911_1920.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


Avoiding the possibility of readers misinterpreting your writing is important, so write *carefully* and *precisely*.
One potential source of confusion is words with a different meaning in research compared to every-day use (*lexical ambiguity*; @dunn2016learning).
The Glossary (Appendix\ \@ref(Glossary)) may prove helpful.
Some specific words where care is needed include:

* *Average*:\index{Averages}\index{Mean}\index{Median}
  In research, 'average' refers to *any* way of measuring the typical value (Sect.\ \@ref(ComputeAverage)) including the mean and the median, but also other measures too (like geometric means, for instance).
  Use the specific word 'mean' or 'median' when that is what you intend.
* *Confidence*:\index{Confidence intervals}
  In research, 'confidence' is usually used in the phrase 'confidence interval' (Sect.\ \@ref(CIInterpretation)).
  Take care when using 'confidence' in other contexts.
* *Comparison*: \index{Comparison}
  Distinguishing between a 'within-individuals' and 'between individuals' comparison is important (Sect.\ \@ref(Intervention)), making sure the type of comparison (within- or between-individuals) is clear.
* *Control*:\index{Control}
  In research, a 'control' refers specifically to a control group, and is helpful for maximising internal validity (Def.\ \@ref(def:Control)).
* *Correlation*:\index{Correlation}
  In research, correlation describes the (often linear) relationship between two *quantitative* variables (Sect.\ \@ref(CorrCoefficients)).
   In general use, 'correlation' is often used to mean 'association' between any types of variables.
* *Estimate*:\index{Estimate}
  In research, 'estimating' usually means to *calculate* an estimate for an unknown population parameter using sample information.
  In general use, 'estimate' often means to make an educated guess.
* *Experiment*:\index{Experiment}
  In research, an experiment is a specific type of research study (Sect.\ \@ref(ExperimentalStudies)).
  Use the word 'study' to talk about experimental and observational studies more generally. 
* *Graph*:\index{Graphs}
  In research, a 'graph' is used to summarise data (Chap.\ \@ref(GraphsConstructing)).
* *Independent*:\index{Independence}
  This words has many uses in statistics and research, in science, and in general use. 
  The word 'independent' in this book refers to events that do not impact each other in a probabilistic sense (Sect.\ \@ref(Independence)).
* *Intervention*:\index{Intervention}
  In research, an 'intervention' (Sect.\ \@ref(Intervention)) is specifically when the researchers can manipulate the comparison.
* *Normal*:\index{Normal distribution}
  In research, 'normal' often refers to the 'normal distribution' (Chap.\ \@ref(NormalDistribution)).
  If this is *not* the meaning you intend to convey, consider using the word 'usual' or a similar word.
* *Odds*:\index{Odds}\index{Probability}
  In research, 'odds' has a specific meaning (Sect.\ \@ref(QualOdds)) and is *different* that probability.
  In general use, 'probability' and 'odds' are often used interchangeably.
* *Population*:\index{Population}
  In research, the 'population' refers to a larger group of interest (Sect.\ \@ref(Population)).
  In general use, 'population' often refers to groups of people.
* *Random*:\index{Random}
  In research, 'random' has a specific meaning: using impersonal chance.
  In general usage, it often means 'haphazard' or 'without planning'.
* *Regression*:\index{Regression}
  In research, 'regression' refers to the mathematical (often linear) relationship between two quantitative variables (Sect.\ \@ref(Regression)). 
* *Sample*: \index{Sample}
  In research, we say (for example) that we 'have one sample of $30$ fungi' (Sect.\ \@ref(IdeaOfSampling)); in some disciplines, this could be described as 'taking $30$ samples'.
* *Significant*:\index{Statistical significance}\index{P@$P$-values!one-tailed}
  This is perhaps the most misused word in scientific writing. 
  In research, 'significance' is usually understood to refer to 'statistical significance' (Sect.\ \@ref(AboutPvalues)) or similar.
  If this is *not* the meaning you intend to convey, consider using the word 'substantial'.
* *Variable*:\index{Variables}
  In research, a 'variable' is something that can vary from individual to individual (Def.\ \@ref(def:Variable)).

Some *symbols* may also have different meanings in research than in some other scientific disciplines; again, care is needed when using these symbols:

* $\beta$:\index{Regression parameter}
  In research, $\beta$ usually refers to the regression parameters (Sect.\ \@ref(Regression-Software)).
* $\rho$:\index{Correlation coefficient}
  In research, $\rho$ refers to the population correlation coefficient (Sect.\ \@ref(CorrCoefficients)).




## Chapter summary

Presentations are a verbal and visual medium, and usually do not include many details of what was done; instead, they focus on the major points and conclusions.

Written documents are more formal, and include more details of *what* was done.
They should be written carefully, using the best technically-correct words precisely.
Use short sentences and omit unnecessary words.

Remember: 'Don’t write so that you can be understood; write so that you can't be misunderstood' (attributed to William Howard Taft), and 'Write what you mean; mean what you write' (attributed to many).

In a student project, students compared the mean reading speed for people when reading two different fonts.
Their RQ@. . . . . was:
  
> Which font allows [...] students to read a pangram the fastest, between a default and what is considered to be a 'easy to read' font.

In their *Abstract*, the conclusion was given as:

> The Georgia font [...] is therefore the faster of the two.

The aim of a student project was 'to determine if the proportion of males and females that use disposable cups on [the university] Campus is the same'.
The two variables observed on each person in the study were whether or not the person used a disposable cup, and the sex of the person.
In reporting the results in their *Abstract*, the students state:
  
> Based on the sample results, the $95$% confidence interval for the population mean number of disposable cups used by males and females is between  $0.690$ and $1.625$. Meaning  that the population mean is likely to fall between those two intervals.

The aim of student project was 'to determine if the average hang time is different between two types of paper plane designs'.
The two variables in the study were design type (Basic Dart; Hunting Flight), and the hang time of the flight of the plane (in seconds).
In reporting the results in their *Abstract*, the students state:
  
> Very strong evidence proving a difference ($P = .000$) between the Basic Dart mean hang time ($881.84\pm 140.73$\ ms) and the Hunting Flight mean hang time ($1504.19\pm 699.86$\ ms). 
> $95$% CI for the means of The Basic Dart ($829.29$ -- $934.39$) and the Hunting Flight ($1242.86$ -- $1765.52$).
