All students in scientific, engineering and health professions need to *read* the research of others; that's how they stay up-to-date with the discipline.
Some students will also need to *write* about their own research or the research of others.
Understanding the language of research is important in either case.

The purpose of writing research is to effectively and clearly communicate.
Formal guidelines for writing and reporting research exist, for experimental studies ([CONSORT](http://www.consort-statement.org/)) and observational studies ([STROBE](https://www.strobe-statement.org)), though we will not delve into these specifically.

The style and expectations vary widely between disciplines, and between journals (even in the same discipline), so in this chapter we make general comments about writing, rather than give specific requirements.


## General tips

As noted above, the purpose of writing research is to effectively and clearly communicate.
In the scientific disciplines, writing *carefully* and *precisely* is important: using the correct words appropriately is crucial.
Think carefully about every word you use to ensure it conveys the correct and intended meaning.
With this in mind, scientific writing:

:::::: {.cols data-latex="[T]"}

::: {.col data-latex="{0.50\textwidth}"}

* **should** avoid ambiguity.
* **should** use terminology consistently.
* **should** use simple, clear but technically-correct language.
* **should** present the facts in an unbiased manner.
* **should** be clear, concise and complete.
* **should** use facts to make statements.
* **should** be complete enough that other professionals can repeat the study.
* **should** avoid unnecessary repetition.

:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.06\textwidth}"}
\ 
<!-- an empty Div (with a white space), serving as
a column separator -->
:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.42\textwidth}"}

* **should not** contain unnecessary words and phrases.
* **should not** be haphazard, jumbled or illogical. 
* **should not** promote personal opinions.
* **should not** reach conclusions not supported by the given evidence.
* **should not** overstate what has been learnt from the study.

As William Howard Taft (27th president of the United States) is claimed to have said: **Don't write so that you can be understood; write so that you can't be misunderstood**.



<!-- SEM2 2022: Canvas Project Task 2B Group 67 -->
:::{.example #WriteWell name="Write what you mean"}
A student project at my university was titled:

> Driving behaviours: Are dark-coloured car owners more likely to park undercover?

What they actually studied was:

> Driving behaviours: Are drivers of dark-coloured cars more likely to park undercover?

Don't just be understood; avoid being *mis*understood!
:::


A series of experimental studies [@oppenheimer2006consequences] concluded that students often believe that using fancy words makes them appear smarter.
However, one conclusion of the research was that using 'fancy' language *does not* achieve this: '*needless* complexity leads to negative evaluations...' (@oppenheimer2006consequences, p. 151; emphasis added).
Always use the best and most appropriate word; only use fancy words if necessary.
One recommendation from the study is to (p. 153)

> ... write clearly and simply if you can, and you'll be more likely to be thought of as intelligent.


## Article structure

Many scientific papers are structured to have these (or similar) sections, though it varies by discipline and journal:

* Title and authors.
* ***A**bstract*: 
  A summary of the whole paper, without details.
* ***I**ntroduction*: 
  *Why* was the study done, and *what* was hoping to be achieved?
* ***M**ethods*: 
  *How* was the study done?
* ***R**esults*: 
  What was found?
* ***D**iscussion* (or *Summary*, or *Conclusions*): 
  What does it *mean*?

Sometimes the *Conclusion* and *Discussion* are separate sections.
Sometimes the acronym AIMRaD or IMRaD is used to remember these sections.
These components capture the six-step research process in this book (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:ReportStructure)).


```{r ReportStructure, fig.cap="The connection between the paper and the steps we have studied.  The Abstract briefly covers all aspects of the study, and the Discussion may combine elements from all areas also.", fig.align="center", fig.height=6.5, fig.width=5.5, out.width='45%'}
source("R/showAIMRAD.R")  
showAIMRAD(debug = FALSE)    
```


### Titles {#WritingTitles}

Titles are important: poor titles can  discourage a reader from reading an article.
A title should clearly describe the main purpose of the article.
Titles sometimes pose questions ('Do warning lights and sirens reduce ambulance response times?'; @data:Brown2000:WarningLights) or provide answers ('No harm from five year ingestion of oats in coeliac disease'; @data:Janatuinen2002:Coeliac).


::: {.example #ArticleTitles name="Article title"}
A good example of a title is:

> Beauty sleep: experimental study on the perceived health and attractiveness of sleep deprived people
>
> --- @data:axelsson:beautysleep

A *poor* example of an article title is:

> The nucleotide sequence of a 3.2 kb segment of mitochondrial maxicircle DNA from Crithidia fasciculata containing the gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit III, the N-terminal part of the apocytochrome b gene and a possible frameshift gene; further evidence for the use of unusual initiator triplets in trypanosome mitochondria

> --- @sloof1987nucleotide

### Authors {#WritingAuthors}

Ensure that everyone who has made an intellectual contribution is listed as an author.
This is ethical practice (Sect.\ \@ref(Ethics)), and includes (based on @brand2015beyond) those who helped with:


:::::: {.cols data-latex=""}

::: {.col data-latex="{0.28\textwidth}"}

* conceptualisation.
* methodology.
* software.
* validation.
* formal analysis.
* investigation.
* resourcing.
:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.03\textwidth}"}
\ 
<!-- an empty Div (with a white space), serving as
a column separator -->
:::

::: {.col data-latex="{0.64\textwidth}"}

* data curation.
* created image or took photographs.
* writing, including writing drafts, reviewing and editing.
* visualization.
* supervision.
* project administration.
* funding acquisition.

:::
::::::


### Abstract {#WritingAbstract}

The *Abstract* is a short section at the start of an article summarising the *whole* paper, including the results; it is *not* an introduction!
The *Abstract* is often the most important part of any article, as it is the only part that many people will read.
Some (but not all) journals require a *structured abstract*, where the *Abstract* contains specific headings (see Sect.\ \@ref(ReadExample1)); these are usually much easier for a reader to follow.

The Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) statement [@cohen2017stard] list *essential* items for *Abstracts* (slightly adapted):

*  *Background and Objectives*:
   List the study objectives (the RQ).
* *Methods*: Describe:
  - The process of *data collection*; 
  - The *type* of study;
  - The *inclusion and exclusion criteria* for individuals;
  - The *settings* in which the data were collected;
  - The *sampling* method (e.g., random or convenience sample);
  - The tools or methods used to *collect the data*.
* *Results*: Provide:
  - The number of individuals in all groups included in the analysis;
  - Estimates of precision of estimates (e.g., confidence intervals);
  - Results of analysis (e.g., hypothesis tests).
* *Discussion*: Provide:
  - A general *interpretation* of the results;
  - *Implications* for practice, including the intended use of the index test;
  - Limitations of the study.

These loosely align with the six steps of research used in this book.


::: {.example #StructuredAbstract name="Structured abstract"}
A research study examined the long-term effects of mortality after amputation [@data:Singh:lowerlimb].
The structured *Abstract*, edited for brevity, is given below (p. 545):

> *Background*: 
> Mortality after amputation is known to be extremely high and is associated with a number of patient features. 
> We wished to calculate this mortality after first-time lower-limb amputation and investigate whether any population or treatment factors are associated with worse mortality.\smallskip
>
> *Objective*: 
> To follow up individuals after lower limb amputation and ascertain the mortality rate as well as population or treatment features associated with mortality.\smallskip
>
> *Study design*: A prospective cohort study [i.e., a study with forward direction]\smallskip
>
> *Methods*: Prospective lower-limb amputations over 1 year ($N = 105$) at a Regional Rehabilitation Centre were followed up for $3$ years.\smallskip
>
> *Results*: 
> After $3$ years, $35$ individuals in the cohort had died, representing a mortality of $33$%. 
> On initial univariate analysis, those who died were more likely to have diabetes mellitus ($\chi^2 = 7.16$, $\text{df} = 1$, $p = 0.007$) [...]
> Diabetes (odds ratio${} = 3.04$, confidence interval ${} = 1.25$--$7.40$, $p = 0.014$)...\smallskip
>
> *Conclusion*: Mortality after amputation is extremely high and is increased in individuals with diabetes...
:::


### Introduction {#WritingIntroduction}

The purpose of the *Introduction* is to:

* gain the interest of readers, and encourage them to read more of the article.
* establish the context and background.
* define the language and definitions used in the study.
* introduce the theoretical groundwork of the subject.
* state the purpose of the paper: Why it was written, and what the authors hope to learn.
* show how the research fills a gap in existing knowledge.

The introduction often includes a literature review too, though sometimes a literature review is a separate section.


### Methods {#WritingMethods}

The *Methods* section (sometimes called *Materials and Methods*) explains how the data were obtained; for example:

* how the *sample* was identified and located.
* how the data were *collected* (the data collection *protocol*).
* how the data were *analysed*, including the software (and version number) used, and the statistical methods used.
* what specialized equipment was used (don't list pencils, rulers, paper, etc.!).


### Results {#WritingResults}

The *Results* summarise the conclusions from the analysis, especially regarding the initial RQ.
The *Results* section:

* shows all the relevant findings from the research.
* presents a summary of the data: the number of observations, the number of missing values, and a verbal description of all variables.
* presents tabular, numerical and/or graphical summaries of the data and relationships of importance.
* gives a brief verbal interpretation of these summaries.
* gives the *results* from any hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.
* identifies trends, consistencies, anomalies, etc.
* does *not* interpret or explain the results (that is the purpose of the *Discussion*).

Unless the dataset is small, the data itself is usually not given (though may appear in an Appendix or online).

::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Cutting-and-pasting software output into reports is rarely acceptable, except for graphs.
:::



### Discussion {#WritingDiscussion}

Sometimes, articles have separate *Conclusion* and *Discussion* sections; sometimes they are combined.
No new information should be presented in this section.
The *Discussion* section:

* summarises the results.
* gives a short evaluation of the results.
* answers the stated RQ.
* discusses limitations (Sect.\ \@ref(Interpretation)), strengths, weaknesses, problems, challenges.
* tries to anticipate and respond to potential questions about the research.

Readers should reach the conclusions based on the *evidence* presented.


### Other sections {#WritingOther}

Most research articles have other sections too.

The *References* (or *Bibliography*) section gives the full citations of any work referenced, in the required format (such as APA, Harvard, etc.).
This is ethical practice.
Most journals have strict guidelines for how references must be listed and formatted.
    
An *Acknowledgements* section thanks and acknowledges other contributions, such as people who legitimately contributed to the manuscript, and research funding bodies.
Avoid saying "The authors would like to thank..." and instead directly thank them: "We thank...".

Often an *Appendix* is included, which contains important material that would otherwise break the flow of the article's narrative.
The *Appendix* may include large tables, images,  discussions of technical details, ...
Sometimes, this material is placed online.


## Further advice

### Constructing tables, graphs and images {#WritingGraphsTables}

Good figures and tables take time and care to prepare.
Their purpose should always be to *display the data in the simplest, clearest possible way*, and should be produced to display the important information of interest.
In general, tables and graphs:

* **should** be discussed (not just presented) in the text.
* **should** be clear and uncluttered.
* **should** includes units of measurement (such as kg) where appropriate.
* **should** be able to be understood without reference to the paper, as far as possible.
* **should** use easy-to-read fonts and colours: for example, ensure the font size is sufficiently large when placed in the article.
* **should** avoid using different colours, line types or fonts unless these have a purpose (i.e., to differentiate between groups in the study), and that purpose is explained.
* **should not** include *chart junk* (such as artificial third dimensions for graphs (Sect.\ \@ref(GraphsConstructing)), and unnecessary lines in tables).

Figures and images typically have captions *below*, while tables typically have captions *above*.
The source of all images (e.g., the photographer) should be acknowledged, when appropriate.

### Presenting numbers

* When presenting numbers, ensure that all figures are rounded appropriately.
  Software may report more decimal places than necessary, for instance.
* If appropriate, ensure units of measurement are given.
* Be consistent and careful with decimal numbers.
  Some journals require numbers to be written with a leading zero, and some do not.
  For example, some require writing $P = 0.024$ and some $P = .024$.



::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Output from software may have to be sensibly rounded before being included in a report (including in tables and graphs).

### Lexically ambiguous words {#LexicalAmbiguity}


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Illustrations/writing-828911_1920.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


Avoiding the possibility of readers misinterpreting your writing is important, so write *carefully* and *precisely*.
One potential source of confusion is words with a different meaning in research compared to every-day use (*lexical ambiguity*; @richardson2013identification; @dunn2016learning).
If you are unsure of the definitions used in this book, use the Glossary (Appendix\ \@ref(Glossary)).
Some specific words where care is needed include:

* **Average**: In research, 'average' refers to *any* way of measuring the typical value (Sect.\ \@ref(ComputeAverage)) including the mean and the median, but also other measures too.
  Use the specific word 'mean' or 'median' if that is what you intend!
* **Confidence**: In research, 'confidence' is usually used in the phrase 'confidence interval' (Sect.\ \@ref(CIInterpretation)).
* **Comparison**: In research, distinguishing between a 'within-individuals' and 'between individuals' comparison is important (Sect.\ \@ref(Comparison)).
* **Control**: In research, a 'control' refers to a specific situation, and is helpful for maximising internal validity (Def.\ \@ref(def:Control)).
* **Correlation**: In research, correlation describes the relationship between two *quantitative* variables (Sect.\ \@ref(CorrCoefficients)).
* **Estimate**: In research, 'estimating' usually means to *calculate* a sample estimate for an unknown population parameter.
  In general use, 'estimate' often means to take a guess.
* **Experiment**: In research, an experiment is a specific type of research study (Sect.\ \@ref(ExperimentalStudies)). 
  Use the word 'study' to talk about experimental and observational studies more generally. 
* **Graph**: In research, a 'graph' is used to summarise data (Chap.\ \@ref(Graphs)).
* **Independent**: This words has *many* uses in statistics and research, in science, and in general use. 
  The word 'independent' in this book refers to events that do not impact each other in a probabilistic sense (Sect.\ \@ref(Independence)).
* **Intervention**: In research, an 'intervention' (Sect.\ \@ref(Intervention)) is when the researchers manipulate the comparison or connection.
* **Normal**: In research, 'normal' often refers to the 'normal distribution' (Chap.\ \@ref(NormalDistribution)).
  If this is *not* the meaning you intend to convey, consider using the word 'usual'.
* **Odds**: In research, 'odds' has a specific meaning (Sect.\ \@ref(QualOdds)) and is *different* that probability.
  In general use, 'probability' and 'odds' are often used interchangeably.
* **Population**: In research, the 'population' refers to a larger group of interest (Sect.\ \@ref(Population)).
  In general use, 'population' usually refers to groups of people.
* **Random**: In research, 'random' has a specific meaning.
  In general usage it often means 'haphazard' or 'without planning'.
* **Regression**: In research, 'regression' refers to the mathematical relationship between two quantitative variables (Sect.\ \@ref(Regression)). 
* **Sample**: In research, we say (for example) that we 'have one sample of $30$ fungi' (Sect.\ \@ref(IdeaOfSampling)); in some disciplines, this could be described as 'taking $30$ samples'.
* **Significant**: This is perhaps the most misused word in scientific writing. 
  In research, 'significance' is usually understood to refer to 'statistical significance' (Sect.\ \@ref(AboutPvalues)).
  If this is *not* the meaning you intend to convey, consider using the word 'substantial'.
* **Variable**: In research, a 'variable' is something that can vary from individual to individual (Def.\ \@ref(def:Variable)).

Some *symbols* may also have different meanings in research than in some other scientific disciplines; again, care is needed when using these symbols:

* $\beta$: In this book, $\beta$ refers to the regression parameters (Sect.\ \@ref(Regression-Software)).
* $\rho$: In this book, $\rho$ refers to the population correlation coefficient (Sect.\ \@ref(CorrCoefficients)).
* $\pm$: In this book, the symbol $\pm$ is used for confidence intervals to describe a *range* of values in which the population parameter probably lies (Sect.\ \@ref(AboutCIs)).


## Style

Different disciplines and journals have their own styles; read articles from your discipline or target journal to see how to write in the required style.
Some general style recommendations include:

* Use short sentences.
* Write using complete sentences.
* Use inclusive language (e.g., 'fire-fighter' rather than 'fireman').
* Omit words, phrases, sentences that add nothing to the paper.
* Check for commonly confused words: there/their; your/you're; affect/effect; chose/choose; etc.
* Ensure capitalisation is correct.
* Use apostrophes (**not** apostrophe's!) correctly.
* Crucially, be unambiguous: Say what you mean, and mean what you say.
* Ensure correct content, grammar, spelling, punctuation, format.
* Use, but do not rely upon, the spell checker.


::: {.example #ShortSentences name="Short sentences"}
The first sentence should be accessible and engaging. 
Here is a very poor first sentence:
  
> Until recently, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), conventionally defined in the pediatric literature as a syndrome of the triad of renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia without a prodrome of hemorrhagic diarrhea, has received little attention in adult practice because the patients are commonly given the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or TTP/HUS and treated as TTP with plasma exchange, augmented in refractory cases with rituximab and sometimes even splenectomy.
>
> --- @tsai2014mechanistic, p. 187
:::


::: {.example #WriteCarefully name="Writing carefully"}
This sentence appeared in a published article (@PsychologyMysore, p. 14; emphasis added):

> 600 teachers, from both Government and Private Schools, have been *drowned* by random sampling.


This sentence is poor: no-one has ever been *drowned* by random sampling.
Possibly, the authors mean that teachers were '*overwhelmed* by participation in many research studies'.
However, later the article states: "Using random sampling a total number of $600$ teachers were selected..." (p. 17), so the initial wording is *wrong*, and I suspect the sample probably wasn't *random* either!

<!-- * Prepositions are not words to end sentences with. -->
<!-- * Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat.) -->
<!-- * Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc. -->
<!-- * Contractions aren't necessary. -->

In a student project at the university where I work, the students compared the heights that students could jump vertically, starting from a crouch (squat) or standing (counter movement jump; CMJ) position.
Every student in the study performed both jumps.
Critique their numerical summary (Table\ \@ref(tab:WriteExercisesProject2)).

In a student project, the aim was 'to determine if the proportion of males and females that use disposable cups on [the university] Campus is the same'.
The two variables observed on each person in the study were whether or not the person used a disposable cup, and the sex of the person.
In reporting the results in their *Abstract*, the students state:
  
> Based on the sample results, the $95$% confidence interval for the population mean number of disposable cups used by males and females is between  $0.690$ and $1.625$. Meaning  that the population mean is likely to fall between those two intervals.

Critique this statement.

In a student project, the aim was 'to determine if the average hang time is different between two types of paper plane designs'.
The two variables in the study were design type (Basic Dart; Hunting Flight), and the hang time of the flight of the plane (in seconds).
In reporting the results in their *Abstract*, the students state:
  
> Very strong evidence proving a difference ($P = .000$) between the Basic Dart mean hang time ($881.84\pm 140.73$\ ms) and the Hunting Flight mean hang time ($1504.19\pm 699.86$\ ms). 
> $95$% CI for the means of The Basic Dart ($829.29$ -- $934.39$) and the  Hunting Flight ($1242.86$ -- $1765.52$).

An article [@data:Baur2012:Firefighters] includes this in the *Abstract*:

> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 45% of on-duty fatalities among firefighters, occurring primarily in firefighters with excess CVD risk factors in patterns resembling the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn).
> Additionally, firefighters have a high prevalence of obesity and sedentary behavior suggesting that MetSyn is also common.
> Therefore we assessed the prevalence of MetSyn in firefighters and its association with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in a cross-sectional study of 957 male career firefighters.
