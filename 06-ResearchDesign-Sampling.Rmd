## Introducing external validity {#IntroExternalValidity}
\index{External validity}\index{Research design!external validity|(}

In a well-designed study, the researchers learn about the *population* by studying just one of the countless possible *samples*.
Ideally the sample that is studied is representative of the population, so the the results from the sample generalise to the population.
This is called *external validity*.\index{External validity}
*External validity* does *not* mean that the results apply more widely than the intended population.


<!-- ::: {.definition #ExternalValidity name="External validity"} -->
<!-- *External validity* refers to the ability to generalise the results to the rest of the population, beyond just those in the sample studied. -->
<!-- ::: -->

::: {.example #ExternalValidPop name="External validity"}
Suppose the *population* in a study is *Californian home owners*.
The sample comprises the Californian home owners studied by the researchers.
If the study is externally valid, the sample is representative of all Californian home owners.

The results will not necessarily apply to home owners outside of Californian (though they may), or all Californian residents.
However, this *is irrelevant for external validity*.
External validity concerns how the *sample* represents the intended population in the RQ, which is *Californian home owners*.

## The idea of sampling {#IdeaOfSampling}
\index{Sampling}

Studying every member of a population is very rare due to cost, time, ethics, logistics and/or practicality.
Instead, a subset of the population (a *sample*) is studied, and *many* different samples are possible.\index{Sample}


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The challenge of research is learning about a population from studying just one of the countless possible samples.

::: {.example #SamplesAspirin name="Samples"}
A study of the effectiveness of aspirin in treating headaches cannot possibly study every single human who may one day take aspirin.
Not only would this be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and impractical, but the study would not even study those not yet born who might use aspirin.

Using the whole target population is *impossible*, and a *sample* must be used.
:::


Only studying one sample out of countless possible samples raises questions:

* *Which* individuals should be included in the sample to be studied?
* *How many* individuals should be included in the sample to be studied?

The first issue is studied in this chapter.
The second issue is studied later (Chap.\ \@ref(EstimatingSampleSize)), after learning about the implications of studying samples rather than populations.

Many samples are possible, and *every sample is likely to be different*.
Hence, the results of studying a sample likely vary, depending on which individuals are in the studied sample.
The differences between the samples, and differences in the results from each sample, are called *sampling variation*.\index{Sampling variation}
That is, each sample has different individuals, produces different data, and may even suggest different answers to the RQ.


:::{.example name="Number of samples"}
In a 'population' of just\ $100$, the number of possible samples of size\ $25$ is more than twice the number of people currently living on earth.
:::


This is the challenge of research: *making decisions about populations, using just one of the many possible samples*.
A lot can be learnt about the population if selecting a sample is approached correctly.\index{Making decisions}


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Almost always, researchers study *samples*, not *populations*.
Many samples are possible, and *every sample is likely to be different*, and hence the *results from every sample are likely to be different*.
This is called *sampling variation*.

As a result, *conclusions from a sample are never certainties*, though special techniques allow us to make decisions about the *population* from a *sample*.
:::


:::{.example #SamplingVarInCards name="Sample vary"}
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Consider a fair pack of cards (a *population*), where $50$% of cards are red. The percentage of red cards is not the same in every hand (every *sample*) of ten cards.'
} else {
   'The animation below shows how samples vary. We know that\ $50$% of cards in a fair, shuffled pack (a *population*) are red, but each hand (every *sample*) of ten cards can produce a different percentage of red cards (and not always\ $50$%).'
}`
This is a simple example of *sampling variation*.\index{Sampling variation}

## Precision and accuracy {#PrecisionAccuracy}

Two questions concerning sampling in Sect.\ \@ref(IdeaOfSampling) were: *which* individuals should be in the sample, and *how many* individuals should be in the sample.
The first question addresses the *accuracy*\index{Accuracy} of using a sample value to estimate a population value.
The second addresses the *precision*\index{Precision} with which a population value is estimated using a sample.
An estimate that is not accurate is called *biased* (Def.\ \@ref(def:Bias)).


::: {.definition name="Accuracy"}
\index{Accuracy}
*Accuracy* refers to how close a *sample* estimate is likely to be to the *population* value, on average.
:::


::: {.definition name="Precision"}
\index{Precision}
*Precision* refers to how similar the sample estimates from different samples are likely to be to each other (that is, how much variation is likely in the sample estimates).
:::


Using this language:

* The sampling *method* (i.e., *how* the sample is selected) impacts the *accuracy* of the sample estimate (i.e., the *external validity* of the study).
* The *size* of the sample impacts the *precision* of the sample estimate (i.e., the *internal* validity).

Large samples are more likely to produce *precise* estimates, but they may or may not be accurate estimates.
Similarly, random samples are likely to produce *accurate* estimates, but they may or may not be *precise*.
As an analogy, consider an archer aiming at a target.
The shots can be accurate, or precise, or (ideally) both (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:PrecisionAccuracy)).

## Types of sampling
\index{Sampling}

One key to obtaining accurate estimates about the population from the sample is to ensure that the sample faithfully represents the population.
So, *how* is such a sample selected from the population?

The individuals selected for the sample can be chosen using either *random sampling* or *non-random sampling*.
The word *random* here has a specific meaning that is different than how it is often used in everyday use.
It does *not* mean 'haphazard' or 'picking individuals as "randomly" as I can'.


::: {.definition #Random name="Random"}
*Random* means determined completely by impersonal chance.
:::


### Random sampling {#RandomSamples}
\index{Sampling!random}

In a *random sample*, each individual in the population can be selected, and is chosen on the basis of impersonal chance (such as using a random number generator, or a table of random numbers).
Some examples of random sampling methods appear in Sect.\ \@ref(RandomSamplingMethods).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
The results obtained from a random sample are likely to generalise to the population from which the sample is drawn; that is, *random samples* are likely to produce *externally valid* and *accurate* studies.

Testing a pot of soup is similar.
If the soup is stirred (randomised), the whole pot of soup need not be tasted.
An *overall* impression of the population (or the soup) is not obtained from a non-random sample (sampling from non-stirred soup).


### Non-random sampling {#NonRandomSamples}
\index{Sampling!non-random}

A *non-random* sample is selected using personal input from the researchers.
Examples include:

* *Judgement samples*:\index{Sampling!non-random!judgement}
  Individuals are selected based on the researchers' judgement (possibly unconsciously), perhaps because the individuals are (or may appear) agreeable, supportive, easily accessible, or helpful.
  For example, researchers may select rats that are less aggressive, or plants that are accessible.
* *Convenience samples*:\index{Sampling!non-random!convenience}
  Individuals are selected because they are convenient for the researcher.
  For example, researchers may study beaches that are nearby, or use their friends for a study.
* *Voluntary response (self-selecting) samples*:\index{Sampling!non-random!voluntary}
  Individuals participate if they wish to.
  For example, researchers may ask people to volunteer to take a survey.
* *Cherry-picking*:\index{Sampling!non-random!cherry-picking}
  Individuals are specifically chosen to reach the conclusion that the researchers want.

In non-random sampling, the individuals *in* the study are probably different than those *not in* the study.
That is, *non-random samples are not likely to be externally valid*.\index{External validity}

Researchers may use a non-random sample intentionally (e.g., to deceive) or unintentionally (e.g., accidentally, or due to practicality (such as meeting budgets)).
Ethically, a random (or near-random sample) should be used when possible.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Using a non-random sample means that the results probably do not generalise to the intended population: they probably do not produce externally valid or accurate studies.

## Methods of random sampling {#RandomSamplingMethods}
\index{Sampling!random}


### Simple random sampling {#SRS}
\index{Sampling!random!simple random}

<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-media-control-55-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>

The most straightforward idea for obtaining a random sample is to use a *simple random sample*.


::: {.definition #SamplingSRS name="Simple random sample"}
In a *simple random sample*, *every* possible sample of a given size has the *same* chance of being selected.
:::


Selecting a simple random sample requires a list of all members of the population, called the *sampling frame*, from which to select a sample.
Obtaining the sampling frame is often difficult or impossible, and so finding a simple random sample is also difficult.
For example, finding a simple random sample of wombats would require having a list and location of all wombats.
This is absurd; other random sampling methods, like 
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  '[special ecological sampling methods](http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/what_method.htm)  (e.g., @manly2014introduction),'
} else {
  'special ecological sampling methods  (e.g., @manly2014introduction),'
}`
would be used instead.



::: {.definition #SamplingFrame name="Sampling frame"}
The *sampling frame* is a list of *all* the individuals in the population.\index{Sampling frame}
:::


Selecting a simple random sample from the *sampling frame* can be performed using *random numbers* (e.g., using random number tables, or 
`r if (knitr::is_html_output()){
  'websites like https://www.random.org).  A smaller version of this webpage, which generates one number at a time, is below; just press *Generate*. The numbers generated by this widget come from the true random number generator at [RANDOM.ORG](https://www.random.org). (The webpage generates as many numbers as you want all at the same time.)'
} else {
  'websites like https://www.random.org).'
}`
Other random sampling methods avoid the need for a sampling frame, but still use randomness rather than human choice.

Consider the letter-typing RQ again (Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing)`r ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), ", p.\\ \\pageref{exm:Typing}", "")`):

> For students in a large university course, is the average typing speed (in words per minute) the same for those aged under\ $25$ ('younger') and $25$\ or over ('older')?

Suppose budget and time constraints mean only\ $40$ students (out of\ $441$) can be selected for the study.
The *sampling frame* is the list of all students enrolled in the course.
Obtaining the sampling frame is feasible here; instructors have access to this information for grading.

A simple random sample could be found using the course enrolment list, and placing all $441$\ student names into rows of a spreadsheet (ordered by name, student\ ID, or any way).
Then, using random numbers, $40$\ rows are selected at random (without repeating numbers) between\ $1$ and\ $441$ inclusive.
For instance, when I used 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '\\texttt{https://random.org/integers},'
} else {
   '[random.org](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=40&min=1&max=441&col=5&base=10&format=html&rnd=new),'
}`
the first few random numbers were: `410`,	`215`,	`384`,	`158`,	`296`, ...

Every student chosen using this method becomes part of the study.
If a student could not be contacted, more students could be chosen at random to ensure $40$ students participated
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesA), left panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`
By chance, the sample comprises\ $15$ younger students and $25$\ older students.

In *systematic sampling*, the first case is *randomly* selected; then, more individuals are selected at regular intervals thereafter.
In general, we say that every\ $n$th individual is selected after the initial random selection.


::: {.example #SystematicCourse name="Systematic sampling"}
For the study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), a sample of $40$\ students in a course of $441$ is needed.
To find a systematic random sample, select a random number between\ $1$ and\ $441/40$ (approximately\ $11$) as a starting point; suppose the random number selected is\ $9$ (as in 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesA), right panel).'
} else {
   'the animation below).'
}`

The first student selected is the $9$th\ person in the student list (which may be ordered alphabetically, by student\ ID, or other means).
Thereafter, every\ $441/40$th person, or\ $11$th person, in the list is selected: people in rows $9$,\ $20$,\ $31$, $42$,\ and so on
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesA), right panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`
By chance, the sample comprises\ $17$ younger students and $23$\ older students.

::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Care needs to be taken when using systematic samples to ensure a pattern is not hidden.
Consider taking a systematic sample of every $10$th residence on a long street.
In many countries, odd numbers are usually on one side of the street, and even numbers usually on the other side.
Selecting every\ $10$th house (for example) would include houses all on the same side of the street, and hence with similar exposure to the sun, traffic, etc.

:::{.example #SystematicQuebec name="Systematic sampling"}
@alary1991risk studied households in Quebec to determine if their hot water systems kept their water sufficiently hot to avoid Legionellae bacteria.
They used a systematic random sample to select households to study (p.\ $2\,361$):

> The first house was selected by using a random-number table. 
> Thereafter, each fifth house that satisfied the [...] criteria was eligible for the study.

### Stratified sampling  {#StratifiedSampling}

<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">
<img src="Pics/iconmonstr-layer-17-240.png" width="50px"/>
</div>


In *stratified sampling*, the population is split into a *small* number of *large* (usually similar) groups called *strata*, then cases are selected using a *simple random sample* from *each* stratum.
Every individual in the population must be in one, and only one, stratum.


::: {.example #StratifiedUni name="Stratified sampling"}
For the typing study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), $20$\ younger and $20$\ older students could be selected to obtain a sample of size\ $40$.
The sample is stratified by *age group* of the person
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesStrat), left panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`

Since $67$% of the students are younger in the population, the sample could be selected so that two-thirds of the sample of size\ $40$ (i.e., $27$\ students) were younger students
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesStrat), right panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`
This is a *proportional* sample.

In *cluster sampling*, the population is split into a *large* number of *small* groups called *clusters*.
Then, a *simple random sample* of clusters is selected, and *every* member of the chosen clusters become part of the sample.
Every individual in the population must be in one, and only one, cluster.


::: {.example name="Cluster sampling"}
For the study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), a simple random sample of (say) three of the many small-group classes for the course could be selected, and *every* student enrolled in those selected small groups constitute the sample
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesB), left panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`
By chance, the chosen classes produce a sample size of $n = 43$ ($31$\ younger; $16$\ older).

</div>


In *multi-stage sampling*, larger collections of individuals are selected using a *simple random sample*, then smaller collections of individuals *within* those large collections are selected using a *simple random sample*.
The simple random sampling continues for as many levels as necessary, until individuals are being selected (at random).


::: {.example name="Multi-stage sampling"}
For the study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), a *simple random sample* of ten of the many small-group classes could be selected (Stage\ 1), and then four students are *randomly* selected from each of these $10$ selected tutorials (Stage\ 2)
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:SamplesB), right panel).'
} else {
   '(see animation below).'
}`
The sample size is $10\times 4 = 40$, comprising (by chance) $24$\ younger students and $16$\ older students.
:::




```{r animation.hook="gifski", interval=0.75, fig.height = 6.5, dev=if (is_latex_output()){"pdf"}else{"png"}}
if (knitr::is_html_output()){

  source("R/showSampleMultistage.R")
  showSampleMultistage(static = FALSE)  
}  
```




::: {.example name="Multi-stage sampling"}
Multi-stage sampling is often used by national statistical agencies.
For example, to obtain a multi-stage random sample from a country:

* *Stage\ 1*: Randomly select some cities in the nation;
* *Stage\ 2*: Randomly select some suburbs in these chosen cities;
* *Stage\ 3*: Randomly select some streets in these chosen suburbs;
* *Stage\ 4*: Randomly select some houses in these chosen streets.

This is cheaper than simple random sampling, as data collectors can be deployed in a small number of cities (only those chosen in Stage\ 1).
:::


### Comparing the samples

The different random sampling methods produce different samples, with different proportions of younger and older students (Table\ \@ref(tab:samplesSummaryTable)).
Of course, repeating the random sampling processes would produce different samples each time.
In all cases, we end up studying *one*  of the countless possible samples.

## Representative sampling {#Representative-samples}
\index{Sampling!representative}

Obtaining a truly random sample is usually hard or impossible in practice.
Sometimes the best compromise is to select a sample sufficiently diverse so that it is likely to be *somewhat representative* of the diversity in the population.
That is, those *in* the sample are not likely to be different than those *not in* the sample, at least for the variables of interest.
This is often the only practical way to sample.

As always, the results from any non-random sample *may not generalise* to the intended population (but will generalise to the population which the sample *does* represent).

::: {.example name="Representative sample"}
Suppose we wish to evaluate the functionality of two types of hand prosthetics.

A randomly-chosen group of Alaska and Texas residents is asked for their feedback, probably (but not certainly) their views would be similar to those of all Americans.
No obvious reason exists for why residents of Alaska and Texas would be very different from residents in the rest of the United States, regarding their view of hand prosthetic functionality.
	
Even though the sample is not a random sample of all Americans, the results *may* generalise to all Americans (though we cannot be sure).
:::


<div style="float:right; width: 222x; border: 1px; padding:10px">

</div>


::: {.example #AirConUse name="Non-representative samples"}
Suppose we wish to determine the average time per day that Americans households use their air-conditioners for *cooling* in summer. 

If a group of Texas residents is asked, this sample would not be expected to represent all Americans: it would *over*-represent the average number of hours air-conditioners are used for *cooling* in summer.
In this case, those *in* the sample are very different to those *not in* the sample, regarding their air-conditioners usage for cooling in summer.

In contrast, suppose a group of Alaskans was asked the same question.
This sample would not represent all Americans either (it would *under*-represent).
Again, those *in* the sample are likely to be very different to those *not in* the sample, regarding their air-conditioners usage for *cooling* in summer.
:::


Sometimes, a *combination* of sampling methods is used.\index{Sampling!combination of methods}

		
::: {.example name="A combination of sampling methods"}
In a study of pathogens present on magazines in doctors' surgeries in Dublin, some suburbs can be selected at *random*, and then (within each suburb) all surgeries are contacted, and some surgeries *volunteer* to be part of the study. 
:::


:::{.exampleExtra data-latex=""}
In a study of diets of children at child-care centres, researchers used samples in\ 2010 and\ 2016, described as follows [@larson2019staff, p.\ 336]:

> In\ 2010, a stratified random sampling procedure was used to select representative cross-sections of providers working in licensed center-based programs and licensed providers of family home-based care from publicly available lists. 
> [...] Additional participants were also recruited in\ 2016 using a combination of stratified random and open, convenience-based sampling.
:::


Sometimes, practicalities dictate how the sample is obtained, which may result in a non-random sample.
Even so, the impact of using a non-random sample on the conclusions should be discussed (Chap.\ \@ref(Interpretation)).
Sometimes, simple steps can be taken to obtain a sample that is *more likely* to be representative.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Random samples are often difficult to obtain, and sometimes *representative* samples are the best that can be achieved,
In a representative sample, those *in* the sample are not obviously different than those *not in* the sample.
Try to ensure that a broad cross-section of the target population appears in the sample.
:::

Even if a random or representative sample cannot be obtained, the study can still be useful.
The results still apply to the population represented by the sample.
If individuals in the sample are unlikely to be different from individuals *not* in the sample, for the variables important to the study, the results are likely to approximately apply to the population.

::: {.example #RepresentativeUni name="Representative sample"}
For the typing study in Example\ \@ref(exm:Typing), only selecting students who attend the gym, or only students who are at a certain Cafe, is unlikely to be somewhat representative of the student population.
Instead, the researchers could approach:

* Students at the Cafe on Monday at\ $8$am;
* Students at the gym on Tuesday at\ $11$:$30$am; and
* Students entering the Library on Thursdays at\ $2$pm.

*This is not a random sample*, but does contain a variety of students.
Ideally, *students would not be included more than once in our sample*, though this is often difficult to ensure.
The students *in* the sample are probably somewhat similar to those *not* in the sample in terms of average typing speeds (there is no obvious reason why they would not be), but we cannot be sure.

To determine if the sample is somewhat representative of the population, sometimes information about the sample and population can be compared.
The researchers may then be able to make some comment about whether the sample seems reasonably representative.
For example, the sex and age of a sample of university students may be recorded; if the proportion of females in the sample, and the average age of students in the sample, are similar to those of the whole university population, then the sample may be considered somewhat representative of the population (though we cannot be sure).

## Sampling biases {#SelectionBias}
\index{Sampling!bias}
   
The sample may not be representative of the population for many reasons, all of which compromise how well the sample represents the population (i.e., compromises *external* validity and accuracy).
This is called *selection bias*.



::: {.definition #SelectionBias name="Selection bias"}
\index{Bias!selection}
*Selection bias* is the tendency of a sample to over- or under-estimate a population quantity.
:::


Selection bias is less common in studies with forward directionality, compared to studies that are non-directional or have backward directionality (Sect.\ \@ref(Directionality)).
*Selection bias* may occur if the wrong sampling frame is used, or non-random sampling is used.
The sample is biased because those *in* the sample may be different than those *not in* the sample (which may not always be obvious).
Biased samples are less likely to produce externally valid studies.

<img src="Illustrations/pexels-juergen-striewski-301048.jpg" width="200px"/>
</div>


::: {.example name="Selection bias"}
Consider Example\ \@ref(exm:AirConUse), about estimating the average time per day that air conditioners are used for cooling in summer.
Even a *random* sample of Alaskans produces a biased sample of Americans: the sampling frame (Alaskans) does not represent the target population ('Americans').
This is *selection bias*.
:::


*Non-response bias* occurs when chosen participants do not respond.\index{Bias!non-response}
Bias occurs because those who *do not* respond may be different than those who *do* respond.
Non-response bias can occur because of a poorly-designed survey, using voluntary-response sampling, chosen participants refusing to participate, participants forgetting to return completed surveys, etc.


::: {.example #BiasOvertime name="Non-response bias"}
Consider a study to determine the average number of hours of overtime worked by various professions.
People who work a large amount of overtime may be too busy to answer the survey.
Those who answer the survey may be likely to work less overtime than those who do not answer the survey.
This is an (extreme) example of *non-response bias*.
:::


*Response bias* occurs when participants provide *incorrect or false information*.\index{Bias!response}
This may be intentional (for example, respondents lie) or non-intentional (for example, the question is poorly written, personal, or misunderstood).


::: {.example #PoorSampling name="Poor sampling"}
Obtaining data using a telephone survey only includes people who own a telephone, who answer the phone, who do not hang up, who volunteer to complete the survey, and who then finish the whole survey.
The people who participate in the survey must meet these criteria, and probably do not represent the population.

Obtaining data using a TV station call-in at about $6$:$15$pm only includes people watching that channel, at that time, and who are sufficiently motivated to call.
These people must meet very specific criteria, and probably do not represent the population.

Sampling students at your university, because it is easier than finding a random sample of all university students in your country, will only generalise to students at that university and not to students at *all* universities.

<!-- ## Final example {#Final-Example} -->

<!-- As a demonstration of sampling schemes [@mypapers:ExperientialLearningStats], consider taking a [*non-random* sample](#NonRandomSamples) of the pixels of an image (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:Sampling-NonRandom)). -->
<!-- What is the image? -->
<!-- Seeing the *big picture* is hard using these non-random samples. -->


<!-- ```{r Sampling-NonRandom, echo=FALSE, out.width='49%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Non-random samples from an image: a small number of pixels (top left); a slightly large number of pixels (top right); a large number of pixels (bottom left); a very large number of pixels (bottom right)", fig.show="hold"} -->

## Chapter summary {#Chap5-Summary}

Almost always, the entire population of interest cannot be studied, so a *sample* (a subset of the population) must be studied.
*Many* samples are possible; only one sample is studied.
Samples can be obtained using *random* or *non-random* methods.
Conclusions made from random samples can usually be generalized to the population (that is, they are externally valid and accurate).

Random sampling methods include *simple random samples*, *systematic samples*, *stratified samples*, *cluster samples*, and *multi-stage samples*.
Random samples are likely to be *externally valid* and *accurate*.

Non-random sampling methods include *convenience samples*, *judgement samples*, and *voluntary (self-selecting) samples*.
Random samples are often very difficult to obtain, so *reasonably representative* samples are sometimes used, where those *in* the sample are unlikely to be very different than those *not in* the sample.
Non-random samples *may not be externally valid* or *accurate*.
