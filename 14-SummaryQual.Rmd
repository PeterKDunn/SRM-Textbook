# Summarising qualitative data {#SummariseQuantData}


## Introduction

As with quantitative data, data are difficult to understanding unless the data set is very small.
For qualitative data, like quantitative data, a graph shows the *distribution* of the data (Def.\ \@ref(def:Distribution)): the values taken by the variable, and how often they appear.
However, the ways in which qualitative data are summarused is different than with quantitative data.


## Graphing qualitive data


The three options for graphing qualitative data are:

* [*Dot chart*](#DotChartsOneQual):
  Usually a good choice.
* [*Bar chart*](#BarCharts):
  Usually a good choice.
* [*Pie chart*](#PieCharts):
  Only useful in special circumstances, and can be harder to interpret.

For *nominal* data, the levels of the variables could be displayed alphabetically, by size, by personal preference, or any other way: use the order most likely to be useful to readers.
For *ordinal* data, the natural order of the levels should almost always be used.

Sometimes these graphs are also used for quantitative data with a small number of possible options.


### Dot charts (qualitative data) {#DotChartsOneQual}

Dot charts indicate the counts (or the corresponding percentages) in each level, using dots on a line *starting at zero*.
The levels can be on the horizontal or vertical axis, and the counts or percentages in the other direction.
Placing the level names on the vertical axis often makes for easier reading, and space for long labels. 


::: {.example #DotPlotsQual name="Dot plots"}
A study of spider monkeys [@data:Chapman1990:SpiderMonkeys] examined the types of social groups present (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:SpiderMonkeys)).
The most common social group has many females plus offspring  (with almost $50$ social groups).
Also, none of the commonly-observed social group include males.
:::


```{r SpiderMonkeys, fig.cap="Dot chart of spider monkey family groups", fig.align="center", fig.width=5.5, fig.height=3.5}
counts <- c(8, 3, 2, 15, 1, 23, 48)
names <- c("Solitary", 
           "All males", 
           "Female + no young", 
           "Mixed young", 
           "Mixed + no young", 
           "One female + offspring", 
           "Many females + offspring")

sort.order <- sort( counts, 
                    index.return = TRUE)

old.mar = par()$mar
new.mar <- old.mar
new.mar[2] <- old.mar[2] * 2.75
par(mar = new.mar )

dotchart( counts[sort.order$ix], 
          pch = 19,
          las = 1, 
          xlim = c(0, 50),
          xlab = "Percentage of observations",
          ylab = "",
          main = "Spider monkey sub-groups")
axis(side = 2, 
     seq_along(counts[ sort.order$ix ]), 
     names[sort.order$ix], 
     las = 1)
abline(v = 0,
	     col = "grey")   # Add zero line for clarity

```

For dot charts:

* Place the qualitative variable on the horizontal or vertical axis (and label with the levels of the variable).
* Use counts or percentages on the other axis.
* For nominal data, *think about the most helpful order* for the levels.


### Bar charts {#BarCharts}

Bar charts indicate the counts in each category using a bar *starting from zero*.
As with dot charts, the levels can be on the horizontal or vertical axis, but placing the level names on the vertical axis often makes for easier reading, and room for long labels. 


::: {.example #IndependenceBarText name="Bar charts"}
In a study of functional independence [@data:Ocepek2013:SmartHome], the type of diagnoses were graphed using a bar chart (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:IndependenceBar)).
For example, two people in the sample have cerebral palsy.
The reason for the different coloured bars is explained in Fig.\ \@ref(fig:IndependencePie).
:::


```{r IndependenceBar, fig.cap="Diagnoses of participants: numbers (left panel) and percentges (right panel)", fig.align="center", out.width='100%', fig.height=3.5, fig.width=10}
Number <- rev( c(11, 10, 9, 8, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 4) )
Diag <- rev( c("Amputation-one leg",
               "Neuromuscular disease",
              "SCI-paraplegia",
              "Rheum. dis. or multiple skeletal injury",
              "SCI-tetraplegia",
              "Cerebral vascular insult",
              "Amputation-both legs",
              "Amputation-arm",
              "Cerebral palsy",
              "Other") )
Diag.Cols <- rev( c( 
                grey(0.8), 
                grey(0.2), 
                grey(0.8),
                grey(0.8),
                grey(0.2),
                grey(0.8),
                grey(0.2),
                rep( grey(0.8), 3) ) )

par( mfrow = c(1, 2),
     mar = c(4, 16, 4, 2) + 0.1)
barplot( Number, 
         names.arg = Diag,
         horiz = TRUE,
         las = 1,
         xlim = c(0, 12),
         main = "Diagnoses of\nparticipants",
         xlab = "Number of participants",
         col = Diag.Cols)


barplot( Number/sum(Number) * 100 , 
         names.arg = Diag,
         horiz = TRUE,
         las = 1,
         xlim = c(0, 20),
         main = "Diagnoses of\nparticipants",
         xlab = "Percentage of participants",
         col = Diag.Cols)
```


For bar charts:

* Place the qualitative variable on the horizontal or vertical axis (and label with the levels of the variable).
* Use counts or percentages on the other axis.
* For nominal data, levels can be ordered any way: *Think about the most helpful order*.
* Bars have gaps between bars, as the bars represent distinct categories.
  In contrast, the bars in histograms are butted together (except when an interval has a count of zero), as the bars represent a numerical scale.



### Pie charts {#PieCharts}

In pie charts, a circle is divided into segments proportional to the number in each level of the qualitative variable.


::: {.example #PieCharts name="Pie charts"}
In a study of functional independence [@data:Ocepek2013:SmartHome], the *severity* of the diagnoses were shown in a pie chart (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:IndependencePie)).
This picture conveys only one piece of information ("$69$% of patients had a less severe injury"), so a graph of any kind is probably unnecessary.

The pie chart colours are used in the bar chart in Example\ \@ref(exm:IndependenceBarText), indicating the severity of the diagnoses.
This is called *encoding* extra information into the bar chart.
:::

   
```{r IndependencePie, fig.cap="Severity of diagnoses of participants", fig.align="center", fig.height=2.75, out.width='40%'}
par( mar = c(0.5, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5) )
pie( c(31, 69),
     labels = c("More severe (31)", 
                "Less severe (69%)"),
     col = c( grey(0.2), 
              grey(0.8)),
     main = "Severity of diagnoses of participants",
     init.angle = 90)
```

Pie charts present challenges:

* Pie charts only work when graphing parts of a whole.
* Pie charts only work when *all* options are present ('exhaustive').
* Pie charts are difficult to use with levels having zero counts, or small counts.
* Pie charts are difficult to read with many categories present.
* Pie charts are hard to read: Humans compare *lengths* (as in bar and dot charts) better than *angles* (as in pie charts) [@data:Friel:Graphs].


::: {.thinkBox .think data-latex="{iconmonstr-light-bulb-2-240.png}"}
In which of these situations is a pie chart *appropriate*?\label{thinkBox:WhenPiechart}
  
1. The percentage of people who use these web browsers: Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
2. For each country in Asia, the percentage of people who own an iPhone.

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
`r webexercises::hide()`
1. A pie chart is *not suitable*.
   The three browsers are not *mutually exclusive* (people can use more than one of these browsers) nor *exhaustive* (some people may use browsers not listed). 
   For example, the percentages *could* be that $65$% use Firefox, $84$% use Chrome, and $20$% use Safari. 
   These add to more than $100$%.
2. A pie chart is *not suitable*, as the percentages are not parts of a whole.
   Each individual (person) has information recorded on *two* qualitative variables: (a) which state the person lives in (many levels); and (b) whether or not they own an iPhone ('yes' or 'no').  
   For example, the percentages *could* be $53$% in Queensland, $61$% in NSW, $41$% in Victoria, and so on.
   They could possibly add to more than $100$%.

### Comparing pie charts and bar charts {#CompareBarPie}

Consider the pie chart in 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   'Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:LCgraphsPDF) (left panel),'
} else {
   'the top panel of Fig.\\ \\@ref(fig:LCgraphsHTML),'
}`
based on data in @data:andersen:1977.
The pie chart displays the number of lung cancer deaths in Fredericia (Denmark) from 1968 and 1971 inclusive, for various age groups (qualitative).
A pie chart *is* appropriate: only one variable is recorded on each individual (the age of each individual person), and the counts are parts of a whole.
However, determining *which* age groups have the most lung cancer deaths is hard.

The equivalent bar chart 
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(right panel)'
} else {
   '(bottom panel)'
}`
makes the comparison easy: clearly the age groups '$65$ to $69$' and 'Over $74$' have slightly fewer deaths than the other age groups.

Recall that the *purpose of a graph is to display information in the clearest, simplest possible way, to help the reader understand the message(s) in the data*.
A pie chart often makes the message hard to see [@siegrist1996use].

## Numerical summaries for quantitative data

Since qualitative data has *levels* (Sect.\ \@ref(Levels)), all qualitative data (nominal; ordinal) can be tabulated by counting the number (and/or computing the percentage of observations) for each level.



::: {.example #OrdinalMedians name="Modes and medians" }
In a study of the taste of bread with varying salt and fibre content [@gkebski2019impact], researchers recorded information from the $300$ subjects, including gender, place of residence, and the subjects' responses to the statement 'Rolls with lower salt content taste worse than regular ones', on a five-point ordinal scale from 'Strongly Agree' to 'Strongly Disagree'.

All three variables are qualitative ('Gender' is *nominal*; the others *ordinal*), and  Table\ \@ref(tab:Bread) displays the number and percentage of observations for each level.
:::


```{r Bread}

Qualitative data, as in Table\ \@ref(tab:Bread), can also be summarised using *proportions* or *percentages*.
These can be given instead of, or with, the counts (as in Table\ \@ref(tab:Bread)).


::: {.definition #Proportion name="Proportion"}
A *proportion* is a fraction out of a total, and is a number between\ $0$ and\ $1$.
:::


::: {.definition #Percentage name="Percentages"}
A *percentage* is a proportion, multiplied by $100$.
In this context, percentages are numbers between $0$% and $100$%.
:::


*Population* proportions are almost always unknown. 
Instead, a population proportion, denoted $p$, is estimated by a *sample* proportion, denoted by $\hat{p}$. 


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
As always, only one of the many possible samples is studied.
*Statistics* are estimates of *parameters*, and the value of the *statistic* is not the same for every possible *sample*.
:::


::: {.pronounceBox .pronounce data-latex="{iconmonstr-microphone-7-240.png}"}
The symbol $\hat{p}$ is pronounced 'pee-hat', and refers to the *sample* proportion.
:::


::: {.example #ProportionsPercentages name="Proportions and percentages"}
Consider again the data in Table\ \@ref(tab:Bread), summarising results from a sample of $n = 300$ respondents.
The *sample proportion* of respondents from a rural location is $30/300$, or $0.1$.
The *sample percentage* of respondents from a rural location is $30/300\times 100$, or $10$%.
:::


## Modes {#Modes}

Because qualitative data has *levels* (Sect.\ \@ref(Levels)), all qualitative data (nominal; ordinal) can be numerically summarised by *counting* the number of observations in each level (or computing the percentage of observations in each level).
The *mode* is the category with the most observations.
Apart from a tabular summary, the mode is the only way to summarise *nominal* data.


::: {.definition #Mode name="Mode"}
A *mode* is a level (or category) of a qualitative variable with the most observations.
:::



::: {.example #OrdinalMedians name="Modes and medians" }
Consider again the data in Table\ \@ref(tab:Bread).
'Gender' is *nominal* qualitative; all other variables are *ordinal* qualitative.
The mode could be used to summarise each variable:

* The two *modes* for gender are 'females' and 'males' ($150$ respondents each).
* The *mode* residence is 'City with $> 100\, 000$ residents' ($130$ responses).
* The *mode* response to the statement is 'Agree' ($84$ responses).
:::



## Medians (and means) for ordinal data {#QualitativeMedianMeans}

*Ordinal* data can be summarised in ways that nominal data cannot be, since *ordinal* data has levels with a natural order. 
Ordinal qualitative data, but *not* nominal qualitative data, can be summarised using *medians*.


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Medians can be used to summarise *quantitative data* and *ordinal* data, but *never* for nominal data.
:::


::: {.example #OrdinalMedians name="Modes and medians"}
Consider again the data in Table\ \@ref(tab:Bread).
'Gender' is *nominal* qualitative, so medians are not appropriate.
The other variables are *ordinal* qualitative, and the median is located at ordered observation $(300 + 1) / 2 = 150.5$, or half-way between ordered observations $150$ and $151$:

* The *median* residence is 'City $20\, 000$ to $100\, 000$ residents'.
* The *median* response to the statement is 'Neutral'.
:::


Means are generally not suitable for numerically summarising qualitative data.
However, *ordinal* data *may be* [numerically summarised like quantitative data](#NumericalQuant) in *special circumstances*: only when

* the categories are considered 'equally spaced'; *and*
* assigning a number to each category is appropriate (perhaps using a mid-point for numerical groups).


::: {.importantBox .important data-latex="{iconmonstr-warning-8-240.png}"}
Means can be used to summarise *quantitative ordinal* data in very special circumstances, but *never* for nominal data.
:::


::: {.example #OrdinalMeans name="Means of ordinal data"}
Consider again the data in Table\ \@ref(tab:Bread).
Means are *not* suitable for summarising 'Gender' since it is nominal.
Means are *not* suitable for summarising 'Place of residence': the categories are *not* equally spaced, the first level is text ('Rural'), and the final level is open-ended (so a mid-point is not appropriate).

The mean response to the statement *may* be sensible *only if the levels are considered equally spaced* (i.e., the distances between successive points on the five-point scale are considered equal).
Then, assigning $1$ to 'Strongly agree' up to $5$ for 'Strongly disagree', the *mean* response is $3.02$ (effectively, 'Neutral').

## Odds {#QualOdds}

Consider again the *small* kidney stone data (Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small)).
For *Method\ A*, the sample contains $81$ successes and $6$ failures.
Another way to numerically summarise this information is to see that there are $81\div 6 = 13.5$ *times* as many successes than failures in the sample.

In other words, for small kidney stones, the *odds* of success for Method\ A is $13.5$ (in the sample).
The sample odds is a *statistic*, and the unknown population odds is a *parameter*.


::: {.definition #Odds name="Odds"}
The *odds* are the number (or proportion, or percentage) of times that an event *happens*, divided by the number (or proportion, or percentage) of times that the event does *not happen*:  
\[
         \text{Odds} = \frac{\text{Number of times event happens}}{\text{Number of times event doesn't happen}}
\]
or (equivalently)  
\[
         \text{Odds} 
          = 
            \frac{\text{Proportion of times event happens}}
                 {\text{Proportion of times event doesn't happen}}.
\]
The *odds* show how many *times* an event *happens* compared to the event *not happening*.

</div>


When computing odds, the count of interest is divided by the *remaining number*, whereas in proportions and percentages the relevant number is divided by the *total number* relevant to the context.

Software often works with odds rather than percentages (for good reasons that we will not delve into).
Understanding *how* software computes the odds is important.


::: {.softwareBox .software data-latex="{iconmonstr-laptop-4-240.png}"}
In a two-by-two table, the odds computed by jamovi can be interpreted in *either* of these ways (i.e., both are correct)
\vspace{-2ex}

* Row\ 1 counts to Row\ 2 counts; *or*
* Column\ 1 counts to Column\ 2 counts.
\vspace{-2ex}

*Both ways are correct*, but one often makes more sense that the other.

Based on Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small), the odds for the Methods computed by software will compare Method\ A compared to Method\ B (not Method\ B to Method\ A).
:::


::: {.example #InterpretingOdds name="Interpreting odds"}
For the *small* kidney stone data, the odds of a success for Method\ A is  $81\div6 = 13.5$.
This can be interpreted as:

* There are $13.5$ *times* as many successes as failures (in the sample); or
* There are $13.5\times 100 = 1350$ successes for every $100$ failures (in the sample).

Either way, successes are *far* more common than failures, for small kidney stones using Method\ A.

What are the odds of a *failure* for Method\ A?
How is this value interpreted?\label{thinkBox:InterpretOdds}

`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '<!--'`
`r webexercises::hide()`
The odds: $6\div81 = 0.0741$.
For every $100$ successes, expect about $0.0741\times 100 = 7.4$ failures.
`r webexercises::unhide()`
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) '-->'`
:::


::: {.example #OddsEG name="Odds"}
Suppose that 67% of students at a particular university were female.
The *population* odds of finding a female is $67 / (100 - 67) = 2.03$: about twice as many students are females compared to non-females.
Alternatively, there are about $100\times 2.03 = 203$ females to every $100$ non-females.

Suppose one specific class had $18$ females and $5$ non-females.
The *sample* odds of finding a female in this class is $18/5 = 3.60$.

Another class had $16$ females and $9$ non-females.
The *sample* odds of finding a female in this class is $16/9 = 1.79$.
:::


::: {.example #ComputingOdds name="Computing odds"}
Consider again the **small** kidney stone data (Table\ \@ref(tab:KS-Small)).
The odds of a success using *Method\ B* is $234/36 = 6.52$.

Working with the corresponding proportions or percentages
`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KidneyRowColLATEX), left table)'
} else {
   '(Table\\ \\@ref(tab:KS-Small-rowPC)'
}`
rather than the numbers gives the same value: $86.7/13.3 = 6.52$.

Take care interpreting odds:
  
* odds are *greater* than $1$: the event is *more* likely to happen than to not happen.
* odds are *equal to* $1$: the event is just as likely to happen as it is to not happen.
* odds are *less* than $1$: the event is *less* likely to happen than to not happen.

## Lost

For *qualitative* data, the tabular summary records the numbers (or percentages, or both) for each level of the variable (Example\ \@ref(exm:NHANESdata)).
With small amounts of information, sometimes just writing the information is better ('$69$% of diagnoses were less severe'; Example\ \@ref(exm:PieCharts)).
