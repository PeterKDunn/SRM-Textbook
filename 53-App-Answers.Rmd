<!-- Remember: some books are not physically in the library, as they have been borrowed. -->
<!-- **1.** Simple random sample:  -->
<!-- A list of all the books held by the library is needed.  -->
<!-- This *may* be possible for a librarian, but probably not possible for a student or non-library staff member. -->
<!-- In principle though, number each book, and randomly select a sample from that list. -->
<!-- **2.** Stratified:  -->
<!-- Use the five campuses as strata, and then a random sample of all the book in each locations. -->
<!-- **3.** Cluster: -->
<!-- Consider each set of shelves as a cluster, and randomly select some shelves, and determine the number of pages in each book on the selected shelves. -->
<!-- **4.** Convenience:  -->
<!-- Finding books in the libraries within reach and easily accessible and on the shelves, -->
<!-- **5.** Multi-stage: Consider taking a random of campuses, then a random sample of the sets of shelves in the selected libraries, then selecting a random shelf from each one, then a small number of random book from each shelf. -->
<!-- **6.** Multi-stage perhaps. -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- **2.** Convenience, but by approaching every $5$th person and going *every day* for a week they are trying to make it a little more representative (and better than the first) -->
<!-- **3.** Self-selecting. -->
<!-- **4.** Convenience.  -->
<!-- But by going every day for two weeks, and at different times and locations each week, and approaching someone every $15$\ mins, the sample will be more representative. -->

<!-- The fourth is the best, but it is still far from 'random'. -->
<!-- None are completely random. -->
<!-- ::: -->


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:SamplingSchools)**:

Answers to exercises in Sect.\ \@ref(FactorsInfluenceYExercises).


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:MineArsenic).**
**1.** Arsenic concentration.
**2.** Distance of the lake from the mine.
**3.** No: measured and recorded, so cannot be lurking.
**4.** Yes: may be related to the response and explanatory variables.
**5.** Confounding variable.
**6.** Observational: researchers do not determine the distance of the lakes from the mine site.
:::


<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:FactorsInfluenceYStudy1)**: -->
<!-- *Response*: depression. -->
<!-- *Explanatory*: diet quality. -->
<!-- *Extraneous*: presumably *all* listed as that is why the researchers obtained this information.  -->
<!-- *None* can be lurking variables, as the researchers measure or observe all of them. -->

<!-- To be *confounding*, the variable must be potentially related to *both* the response *and* explanatory variables. -->
<!-- Hence, all of the extraneous variables could potentially be confounding variables.  -->
<!-- ::: -->


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:FactorsInfluenceYStudy2)**:
*Response* variable: something like 'risk of developing a cancer of the digestive system'.
*Explanatory* variable: 'whether or not the participants drank green tea at least three times a week'.

*Lurking* variable: 'health consciousness of the participants', because the researchers don't seem to have measured or observed this.
:::


<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:FactorsInfluenceYStudy3)**: -->
<!-- Older children more likely to be smokers, and would be larger in general: age is a confounding variable. -->
<!-- Age is easy to record, and usually *is* recorded in these types of studies, so probably *not* a lurking variable. -->
<!-- ::: -->



## Answers: Designing experimental studies {#DesigningExperimentsAnswer}

<!-- Carry-over effect; observer effect. -->
<!-- ::: -->


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ResearchTasteOfWater2)**:
Observer effect.
The researcher is directly contacting the subjects, so may unintentionally influence their responses.
:::




<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ResearchDesignTasteOfWater3)**: -->
<!-- **1.** Randomly allocate the type of water to the subject (or the *order* in which the subjects taste each drink.) -->
<!-- **2.** The subjects do not know which type of water they are drinking. -->
<!-- **3.** The person providing the water and receiving the ratings does not know which type of water they are drinking. -->
<!-- **4.** Hard to find a control. -->
<!-- **5.** Any random sampling is good, if possible. -->
<!-- ::: -->


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ResearchDesignSunscreen)**:
**1.** *Response*: amount of sunscreen used;
*Explanatory*: time spent on sunscreen application.
**2.** Potential confounding variables.
**3.** If the mean of both the response and explanatory variables was different for females and males, then the sex of the participant would be a *confounding* variable, and this would need to be factored into the analysis of the data.
**4.** Participants blinded to what is happening in the study.
:::






## Answers: Designing observational studies {#DesigningObservationalAnswer}

Answers to exercises in Sect.\ \@ref(DesigningObservationalExercises).


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ResearchDesignObsTrueFalse).**
The second statement is true.
:::


<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ResearchDesignObsPollen).** -->
<!-- Probably in case the size of the hive is a confounding variable. -->
<!-- ::: -->


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ResearchDesignTasteOfWater)**:
*Random allocation*: *not possible* for observational studies.
*Blinding*: means students are not aware of which water they drink; in an observational study, probably infeasible.
*Double blinding*: neither the students nor the researchers know which type of water the students are drinking; probabky infeasible.
*Control*: not sensible. 
*Random sample*: any random sampling method is preferred; possible, but unlikely. 
:::


<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ResearchDesignHawthorneEffect)**: -->
<!-- No; also possible in observational studies. -->
<!-- ::: -->



::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ResearchDesignSleep)**:
Patients probably knew they were involved; Hawthorne effect should be considered in interpretation.

## Answers: Study design limitations {#InterpretationAnswer}

Answers to exercises in Sect.\ \@ref(InterpretationExercises).



::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ValidityLighting).**
External.
:::



<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:InterpretationExerciseValidities).** -->
<!-- Ecological; external; internal; confounding; sampling. -->
<!-- ::: -->


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:InterpretationExerciseExternalValidity)**:
Population: 'on-campus university students where I work'.
External validity refers to whether the results apply to other members of *this* population, not to people outside this population (such as members of the general public).
:::



<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:InterpretationExerciseParachutes)**: -->
<!-- Not *ecologically valid* (parachutes are used at high altitude, for example). -->
<!-- Probably not *externally valid*: voluntary (and presumably convenience) sample. -->
<!-- *Internal validity* may be fine... -->
<!-- ::: -->



::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:InterpretationSleep)**:
The sample is not random; the researchers are (rightly) state that results may not *generalise* to all hospitals.
Because the data was only collected at night, perhaps the study is not *ecologically valid*.
:::


<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:LimitationsShopping).** -->
<!-- Internal. -->
<!-- ::: -->




## Answers: Collecting data {#CollectionAnswer}

Answers to exercises in Sect.\ \@ref(CollectionExercises).

<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:CollectSurveyQuestions1B).** -->
<!-- '2 children' belong in two categories (not mutually exclusive); '4 children' does not belong in any category (not exhaustive). -->
<!-- ::: -->




::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:CollectSurveyQuestions2)**: 
The second is best.
The first is *leading*: Should *concerned* cat owners...
The third is *leading* also (Do you *agree*...)
:::



<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:CollectSurveyQuestions2B).** -->
<!-- The first is *leading*, using the phrase 'environmentally friendly'. -->
<!-- The first and second only present the option of 'owning' -->
<!-- The third is the best question. -->
<!-- ::: -->


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:SunscreenQuestions)**.
The first question seems fine, but 'seldom' (for instance) may mean different things to different people; possible recall bias.
The second question has overlapping options: Both $1$\ h and $2$\ h are in two categories.
:::



<!-- ::: {.answer data-latex=""} -->
<!-- **Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:KidsEnvironmentQuestions).** -->
<!-- The first two are *closed*, with one option to be selected. The other is *open*. -->
<!-- I'm not sure primary school children could recall the answers to the first two questions accurately... -->
<!-- ::: -->

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:NumericalQuantTyping).**
**1.** `mAcc` is highly *left* skewed; `Age` is highly *right* skewed; `mTS` is slightly right skewed.
So perhaps best to use medians and IQRs for summarising (though mean and standard deviation is probably OK for `mTS`).
See Table\ \@ref(tab:TypingUnivar).
**2.** See Table\ \@ref(tab:TypingCompare).
**3.** Seems little difference between males and females in the *sample*.

Correlation coefficients are *very* hard to estimate! 
You are not expected to be very accurate (you cannot be). 
The actual value (from software) is $r = 0.71$.
Realistically, the best you can do is 'a reasonably high positive $r$ value'.

**1.** *Form*: may start off straight-ish, but then seems hard to describe.
       *Direction*: biomass increases as age increases (on average). 
       *Variation*: small-ish for small ages; large-ish for older trees (after about 60 years old).
**2.** Each point represents a tree.

Slightly right skewed, with no obvious outliers.
* *Typing accuracy*: Average: around $85$%; variation: from about $65$% to about $95$%.
Left skewed, with no obvious outliers.
* *Age*: Average: $25$; variation: from about $15$ to $35$.
*Very* right skewed, perhaps large outliers we cannot see.
* *Sex*: About twice as many females as males did the typing test.
* *Speed* and *Sex*: Not a great difference between males and females.
* *Accuracy* and *Age*: Older people generally slower; younger people generally slower. 
Greater variation in accuracy for younger participants.

Average speed and accuracy seems to vary by age but not sex.

<!-- **1.** That the population mean is $12$\ inches, as claimed.  -->
<!-- We have no evidence to refute this claim. -->
<!-- **2.** *First*: the *population* mean diameter is $\mu = 12$ inches; the *sample* mean is not $12$\ inches due to sampling variation.  -->
<!-- *Second*: the *population* mean diameter isn't $12$\ inches, reflected in the sample. -->
<!-- **3.** $11.48$ is $0.52$\ inches from the target of $12$; seems unlikely that the sample mean would be that far from $12$ inches through sampling variation alone. -->
<!-- **4.** $\bar{x} = 11.25$ inches is further from $\mu = 12$ that $\bar{x} = 11.48$: claim probably not supported.  -->

**1.** Standard deviation.
**2.** Standard error. More specifically, the standard error of the mean.
**3.** Standard deviation.
**4.** Standard error. More specifically, the standard error of the proportion.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:HasStandardError)**:
**1.** No: Population proportions don't vary from sample to sample.
**2.** Yes: varies from sample to sample.
**3.** Yes: varies from sample to sample.
**4.** Yes: varies from sample to sample.
**5.** No: Population odds don't vary from sample to sample.

From tables, the probability is $0.3821$, or about $38.2$%.
**2.** $z = 0.07$; probability is $1 - 0.52379 = 0.4721$, or about $47.2$%.
**3.** The $z$-scores are $z_1 = -0.67$ and $z_2 = 0.44$; the probability is $0.6700 - 0.2514 = 0.4186$, or about $41.9$%. (Draw a diagram!)
**4.** Using the tables 'backwards': $z$-score is about $1.04$; corresponding tree diameter is $x = 8.8 + (1.04\times 2.7) = 11.608$, or about $11.6$\ inches.

**1.** $z = (39 - 40)/1.64 = -0.6097561$, or $z=-0.61$. 
Using tables: probability *less than* this value of $z$ is $0.2709$, so the answer is $1 - 0.2709 = 0.7291$, or about $72.9$%.
**2.** $z = (37 - 40)/1.64 = -1.83$; probability is $0.0336$, about $3.4$%.
**3.** The two $z$-scores: $z_1 = -4.878$ and $z_2 = -1.83$. 
Drawing a diagram, probability is $0.0336 - 0 = 0.0336$, or about $3.4$%.
**4.** The $z$-score: $1.64$ (or $1.65$). 
Gestation length: $x = 40 + (1.64 \times 1.64) = 42.7$ (same answer to one decimal place using $z = 1.65$). 
$5$% of gestation lengths *longer* than about $42.7$ weeks. 
**5.** $z$-score is $-1.64$ (or $-1.65$). 
Gestation length: $x = 40 + (-1.64 \times 1.64) = 37.3$ (same answer to one decimal place using $z = -1.65$).

**4.** This doesn't make sense:  *populations* can't vary between two values. 
Even population *parameters* don't vary.
**5.** The population parameter does not vary. 
It is a fixed (but unknown) value to be estimated.
(If the value of the population mean was constantly changing, it would be very hard to estimate...)
**6.** We know *exactly* what the sample mean is ($\bar{x}=1.3649$\ mmol/L: We don't need a interval for the sample mean.
**7.** We know *exactly* what the sample mean is ($\bar{x}=1.3649$\ mmol/L: We don't need a interval for the sample mean.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:ChewingTime)**:
$\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}) = 5.36768$, so the approximate $95$%\ CI is $61.3\pm (2 \times 5.36768)$, which is $61.3\pm 10.74$s (or $50.56$\ s to $72.04$\ s).
Since $n = 30$, which is greater than $25$, the CI is likely to be statistically valid.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:OneTSpeed).**
**1.** $\mu$, the mean speed in the *population* (in km.h^-1^).
**2.** $\text{$H_0$: } \mu = 90$ and $\text{$H_1$: }\mu > 90$ (one-tailed).
**3.** $\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{13.874}{\sqrt{400}} = 0.6937$.
**5.** $t = (\bar{x} - \mu)/\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}) = (96.56 - 90)/0.6937 = 9.46$.
**6.** The $t$-score is a *huge* value; the (one-tailed) $P$-value is very small.
**7.** Write (remembering the alternative hypothesis is one-tailed):
There is very strong evidence ($t = 9.46$; one-tailed $P < 0.001$) that the mean speed of vehicles on this road (sample mean: $96.56$ (approx. $95$%\ CI: $95.17$ to $97.95$); standard deviation: $13.874$) is greater than $90$\ km.h^-1^.

$H_0$: $\mu = 10$ (or $\mu \ge 10$) and $H_1$: $\mu < 10$.
*Females*: $\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}) = 0.05924742$; $t = -25.32$ which is *huge*, so $P$-value is extremely small.
*Males*: $\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}) = 0.0700152$; $t = -19.42$ which is *huge*, so $P$-value is extremely small.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:TestOneMeanBloodLoss)**:
$H_0$: $\mu = 1000$ and $H_1$: $\mu \ne 1000$, where $\mu$ is the population mean guess of the spill volume.
Standard error: $46.15526$.
$t$-score: $(846.4 - 1000)/46.15526 = -3.33$, which is very large (and negative), so the $P$-value will be very small.
Very strong evidence that the mean guess of blood volume is not $1000$\ ml, the actual value.
The sample is much larger than $25$: the test is statistically valid.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:PairedCIExercisesBrocolli)**:
Mean of the *differences*: $5.2$; standard error $3.6$.
*Approximate* $95$%\ CI: $5.2 \pm (2\times 3.06)$, or $5.2\pm 6.12$, from $-0.92$ to $11.22$.
(Understanding how the *differences* are defined is needed to understand where this came from.)
Mean taste preference between preferring it better *with* dip by up to $11.2$\ mm on the $100$\ mm visual analogue scale, or preferring it *without* dip by a little (up to $-0.9$\ mm on the $100$\ mm visual analogue scale.

<!-- $\bar{d} = 7.70$ fmol/mol and the *standard error for this increase* is $3.10$\ fmol/mol. -->

<!-- ::: -->



::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:MeanDiffCOVIDCI).**
**1.** The *differences* are defined as *during* minus *before*, so that *positive* difference therefore means the *during* value is higher.
**2.** $\text{s.e.}(\bar{d}) = {s_d}/{n} = {51.30}/{\sqrt{213}} = 3.515018$.
**3.** From $-4.35$ to $9.71$\ mins.
The lower value is *negative*; this does **not** mean a negative amount of PA (which would make no sense).
The CI is for the population mean *increase* during compared to before lockdown, so, a negative value means that the *before* values are higher than the *during* values on average. The CI means: 'In the population, the mean difference between the amount of vigorous PA by Spanish health students is between $4.35$\ mins more *during* lockdown, and $9.71$\ mins more *before* lockdown.'

$H_0$: $\mu_d = 0$ and $H_1$: $\mu_d > 0$: *differences* are positive when the dip rating is better than the raw rating.
$t = (5.2 - 0)/3.06 = 1.699$; the *approximate* one-tailed $P$-value, from using the $68$--$95$--$99.7$ rule, is somewhere between $16$% and $2.5$%. 

So we cannot be sure if the $P$-value is larger than $0.05$... but it is likely that it is (since the calculated $t$-score is quite a  distance from $z = 1$).
The evidence *probably* doesn't support the alternative hypothesis.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:TestPairedMeansFerritin)**:
$H_0$: $\mu_d = 0$ and $H_1$: $\mu_d > 0$, where *differences* refer to the *reduction* in ferritin. 
$\bar{d} = -424.25$ and $s = 2092.693$ and $n = 20$, so $t = -0.90663$.
$t$ is 'small'; $P > 0.05$ (actually $P = 0.376$): the evidence doesn't support the alternative hypothesis.
Since $n < 25$, the test may not be statistically valid (the histogram of data (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:FerritinGraph)) suggests that the population *might* have a normal distribution), though the $P$-value is very large so it probably makes little difference.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:MeansIndSamplesExercisesWhalesCI).**
**1.** Define the *difference* as the mean length of female gray whales *minus* the mean length of male gray whales. (Either direction is fine, as long as you are consistent.)
**2.** The parameter: $\mu_F - \mu_M$ (where $F$ and $M$ represent female and male gray whales respectively).
The estimate: $\bar{x}_F - \bar{x}_M = 4.66 - 4.60 = 0.06$\ m.
**3.** See \@ref(fig:WhalesErrorbar).
**4.** From $-0.12$\ m to $0.25$\ m. 'The population mean difference between the length of female and male gray whales at birth has a $95$% chance of being between $0.12$\ m longer for male whales to $0.25$\ m longer for female whales.'
**5.** Both sample sizes are larger than $25$, so the CI is likely to be statistically valid.

**4.** $6.34 \pm (2\times 0.2446822)$, or $5.85$ to $6.83$ days.
**5.** Sample sizes are large, so the CIs statistically valid.

The difference between the means is an average of $0.53$ days; about half a day (quicker on echinacea). 
Probably not that important when a cold last for almost seven days.

**5.** Both sample sizes are less than $25$, so probably not statistically valid.
**6.** Based on the sample, a $95$%\ CI  for the difference between population mean one-step fall-recovery angle for healthy women is between $9.1$ and $19.9$ degrees *greater* for younger women than for older women (two independent samples).

## Answers: Tests for two means {#TestTwoMeansAnswer}

Answers to exercises in Sect.\ \@ref(TestTwoMeansExercises).


::: {.answer data-latex=""}
**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:TwoSampleHTWhalesHT).**

**1.** The mean length of female gray whales *minus* the mean length of male gray whales.
(Either direction is fine, provided you are consistent.)
**2.** $H_0: \mu_F - \mu_M = 0$ and $H_1: \mu_F - \mu_M \ne 0$.å
**3.** $t = [(\bar{x}_F - \bar{x}_M) - (\mu_F - \mu_M)]/{\text{s.e.}(\bar{x}_F - \bar{x}_M)} = (0.06 - 0)/0.0929 = 0.65$.
This is a *very* small $t$-score, so the $P$-value will be very large.
**4.** There is no evidence ($t = 0.65$; two-tailed $P > 0.10$) in the sample that the mean length of adult gray whales is different in the population for females (mean: $12.70$\ m; standard deviation: $0.611$\ m) and males (mean: $12.07$\ m; standard deviation: $0.705$\ m; $95$%\ CI for the difference: $-1.26$\ m to $0.246$\ m).
**5.** Since both sample sizes are large, the test is statistically valid.

**3.** Very strong evidence in the sample ($P < 0.001$) that the mean annual sugar consumption per person is different for industrialised (mean: $41.8$\ kg/person/year) and non-industrialised (mean: $24.6$\ kg/person/year) countries ($95$%\ CI for the difference $11.95$ to $22.54$).

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:FacePlantHT).**
**1.** Either direction is fine; the amount by which younger ($Y$) women can lean further forward is $\mu_Y - \mu_O$.
**2.** One-tailed, according to the RQ.
**3.** $H_0$: $\mu_Y - \mu_O = 0$ or $\mu_Y = \mu_O$. $H_1$: $\mu_Y - \mu_O > 0$ or $\mu_Y > \mu_O$.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:TestTwoMeansBodyTemperature)**:
$H_0$: $\mu_M - \mu_{F} = 0$ and $H_1$: $\mu_M - \mu_{F} \ne 0$.
From output, $t = -2.285$; (two-tailed) $P$-value is $0.024$.
Moderate evidence to support $H_1$.

Moderate evidence ($P = 0.024$) that the mean internal body temperature is different for females (mean: $36.886^{\circ}\text{C}$) and males (mean: $36.725^{\circ}\text{C}$).

The difference between the means, of $0.16$ of a degree, is hardly of any *practical* importance in everyday use.

**Answer to \@ref(exr:OddsRatiosCIEarInf)**:
The output can be interpreted in one of two ways (Sect.\ \@ref(CIOddsRatiosSummaries)):

* Odds are the odds of swimming at the beach; OR compares these odds between those without an ear infection, to those with an ear infection.
* Odds are the odds of *not* having an ear infection; OR compares these odds for beach swimmers to non-beach swimmers.

Odds of no rainfall (non-positive SOI): $14/40 = 0.35$.
Odds of no rainfall (negative SOI): $7/53 = 0.1320755$.
OR is $0.35/0.1320755 = 2.65$, as in output.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:PetBirdsCI)**:
The numerical summary: Table\ \@ref(tab:BirdsNumericalSummary) (some parts computed *manually* from the data).
The graphical summary: (Fig.\ \@ref(fig:BirdsGraphs)).
The *sample* OR is $2.257$, and the $95$%\ CI  is from $1.605$ to $3.174$.
We write:
Based on the sample, a $95$%\ CI for the OR of keeping a pet bird is from $1.605$ to $3.174$ (comparing people *with* lung cancer to those *without* lung cancer).

The CI will be statistically valid as all expected counts exceed five.

The missing entries: Odds: $1.15$; Percentage: $58.1$%.
$\chi^2 = 4.593$; approximately $z = \sqrt{4.593/1} = 2.14$; expect small $P$-value.
Software gives $P = 0.032$.
Evidence that the difference between the sample proportions is unlikely to be due to sampling variation.
The test is statistically valid.

**1.** $H_0$: $\rho = 0$ and $H_1$: $\rho \ne 0$.
**2.** The $P$-value suggests no evidence of a linear relationship.
**3.** No scatterplot is provided, so the test is statistically valid only if the relationship is approximately linear, and if the variation in STAI scores does not change for different levels of work experience.
The sample size is larger than $25$, however.

$r$ is not relevant as relationship is non-linear.
**2.** Regression is inappropriate: the relationship is non-linear.
**3.** $y$ should be $\hat{y}$; the slope and intercept have been *swapped* (from the plot, the intercept for their line is about $0.4$, which they give as the slope).

**1.** $\hat{y} = 150.19 - 0.348x$, where $y$ represents the mean number of ED patients, and $x$ the number of days since welfare distribution.
**2.** Each extra day after welfare distribution is associated with a *decrease* in the mean number of ED patients of about $0.35$.
Perhaps easier: Each $10$ extra days after welfare distribution is associated with a *decrease* in the number of ED patients of about $10\times 0.35 = 3.5$.
**3.** $-0.34790 \pm 0.093344$, equivalent to $-0.441$ to $-0.255$ patients per day.
**4.** From the output, the test statistic is $t = -7.45$, which is very large; unsurprisingly, the two-tailed $P$-value is very small: $P < 0.001$.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:RegressionExerciseSunscreen)**:
**1.** $b_0$: When someone spends *no* time on sunscreen application, an average of $0.27$\ g has been applied; nonsense.
$b_1$: Each extra minute spent on application adds an average of $2.21$\ g of sunscreen: sensible.
**2.** The value of $\beta_0$ could be zero... which would make sense.
**3.** $\hat{y} = 0.27 + (2.21\times 8) = 17.95$; an average of about $18$\ g.
**4.** About $64$% of the variation in sunscreen amount applied can be explained by the variation in the time spent on application.
**5.** $r = \sqrt{0.64} = 0.8$, and need a positive value of $r$. 
A strong and positive correlation between the variables.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:WriteExercisesStudent2)**:
No units of measurement given (they are centimetres.); jump-heights are given to $0.001$ of a centimetre... which seems rather optimistic; table gives information for the *differences*, which is great but it could also provide numerical summary information for each individual jump type too; a numerical summary shouldn't include a $P$-value, $t$-score, or confidence interval.

**Answer to Exercise\ \@ref(exr:WriteExercisesStudent3)**:
Variables are *qualitative*, so means inappropriate; the appropriate summary is an odds ratio, so the values almost certainly refer to the CI for the OR.
