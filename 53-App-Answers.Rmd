Remember: some books borrowed, and not physically in the library!
**1.** Simple random sample:
list of all the books held by the library is needed.
*May* be possible, but probably not for a student or non-library staff member.
In principle: number each book, randomly select a sample from that list.
**2.** Stratified:
campuses as strata; a random sample of all the book in each location.
**3.** Cluster:
each shelf as a cluster; randomly select some shelves; determine the number of pages in each book on the selected shelves.
**4.** Convenience:
finding books in the libraries easily accessible.
**5.** Multi-stage: 
random sample of campuses; random sample of shelves in the selected libraries; random shelf from each one; a small number of random book from each shelf.
**6.** Multi-stage perhaps...?

**3.** Self-selecting.
**4.** Convenience.

**Ex.\ \@ref(exr:FactorsInfluenceYStudy1)**:

**Ex.\ \@ref(exr:RegressionExercisePunting)**:
**1.** Intercept *not* about $110$; that's where the line 'stops', but the intercept is the predicted value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
We have to extend the line quite a bit.
Using rise-over-run, guess slope is $(190 - 110)/(180 - 110) = 1.14$.
**2.** $\hat{y} = -3.69 + 1.04x$, where $y$ is punting distance (in feet), and $x$ is right leg strength (in pounds).
**3.** For each extra pound of leg strength, the punting distance increases, on average, by about 1 foot.
**4.** $H_0$: $\beta = 0$; $H_1$: $\beta \ne 0$.
(You could answer in terms of correlations.)
Question stated as two-tailed question, but testing if stronger legs *increase* kicking distance seems sensible.
**5.** $t = 6.16$, which is huge; $P = 0.0001$ (two-tailed).
**6.** $0.70$ to $1.4$\ ft.
**7.** Very strong evidence in the sample ($t = 6.16$; $P = 0.0001$ (two-tailed)) that punting distance is related to leg strength (slope: $1.0427$; $n = 13$).

**Ex.\ \@ref(exr:RegressionExerciseBitumen)**:
**1.** $\hat{y} = 17.47 - 2.59x$, where $x$ is the percentage bitumen by weight, and $y$ is the percentage air voids by volume.
**2.** *Slope*: an increase in the bitumen weight by one percentage point *decreases* the average percentage air voids by volume by $2.59$ percentage points.
*Intercept*: dodgy (extrapolation); in principle $0$% bitumen content by weight, the percentage air voids by volume is about $17.47$%.
**3.** $t = -74.9$: massive! Extremely strong evidence ($P < 0.001$) of a relationship.
**4.** $\hat{y} = 4.5027$, or about $4.5$%.
Expected good prediction, as relationship is strong.
**5.** $\hat{y} = 1.909$, or about $1.9$%.
Might be a poor prediction, since this is extrapolation.

**Ex.\ \@ref(exr:RegressionExerciseSunscreen)**:
**1.** $b_0$: *No* time spent on sunscreen application, average of $0.27$\ g has been applied; nonsense.
$b_1$: Each extra minute spent on application adds an average of $2.21$\ g of sunscreen: sensible.
**2.** $\beta_0$ could be zero... which would make sense.
**3.** $\hat{y} = 18$\ g.
**4.** About $64$% of the variation in sunscreen amount applied can be explained by the variation in the time spent on application.
**5.** $r = 0.8$ (must be positive value). 
A strong positive correlation between the variables.

Regression equation implies predicting $0.0001$ of a gram.

**2.** No.
**3.** Possibly; no idea of accuracy of predictions really.
**4.** Intercept: Weight of infant with chest circumference zero; silly.
Slope: average increase in birth weight (in g) for each increase in chest circumference by one cm.
**5.** Intercept: cm; slope: cm/gram.
